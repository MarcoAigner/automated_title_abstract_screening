True," The study meets the inclusion criteria as it is a controlled clinical trial in adults with angina, and it examines the effect of amlodipine on supraventricular arrhythmias and systolic dysfunction."
True," This study meets all the inclusion criteria, as it is a controlled clinical trial in adults with hypertension, comparing the effects of two different antihypertensive medications (enalapril and nifedipine) on nitric oxide activity in systemic and renal circulation."
True," The study meets all inclusion criteria, as it is a controlled clinical trial in adults with hypertension, and the outcomes of interest (e.g. vasodilatory adverse events, blood pressure control) are relevant to the review."
True," This study meets the inclusion criteria as it is a controlled clinical trial that compares the effectiveness of two different formulations of nifedipine in patients with hypertension, and reports outcomes relevant to the review."
False," The study population does not match the specified criteria, as the title mentions ""the elderly"" but the inclusion criteria specify adults with hypertension and other cardiovascular conditions."
True," This study meets all the inclusion criteria, including being a controlled clinical trial in adults with hypertension, comparing a calcium channel blocker (felodipine-metoprolol) with another oral antihypertensive drug (enalapril), and reporting outcomes related to hypertension and quality of life."
True," This study meets all the inclusion criteria, including being a controlled clinical trial in adults with hypertension, having a duration of 6 months, and evaluating the effectiveness of a calcium channel blocker (verapamil SR) in combination with an ACE inhibitor (trandolapril) for hypertension."
True," The study meets all the inclusion criteria, including being a controlled clinical trial in adults with hypertension, comparing a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine GITS) with another oral antihypertensive drug (bendrofluazide), and reporting outcomes relevant to hypertension."
True," The study meets the inclusion criteria as it is a controlled clinical trial in adults with angina, comparing the safety of nifedipine with active drug controls, and reporting outcomes related to cardiovascular events."
False," The study does not meet the inclusion criteria because it does not involve hypertension, angina, supraventricular arrhythmia, or systolic dysfunction, and the intervention is not a calcium channel blocker compared with another calcium channel blocker, another oral antihypertensive drug, or a placebo."
