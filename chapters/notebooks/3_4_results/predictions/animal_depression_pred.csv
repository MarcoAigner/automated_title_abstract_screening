True," The study provides primary data from an animal model of depression, with a control group, and investigates the effects of ethanol and desipramine on beta-adrenoceptor function in rat brain."
False," The study does not investigate a model of depression, but rather the effects of cyclophosphamide and adriamycin on wound healing in mice."
False,The article does not provide primary data of an animal model of depression or depressive-like phenotype with an appropriate control group.
False," The article does not provide primary data of an animal model of depression or depressive-like phenotype, but rather discusses the use of peptides to protect against myelotoxicity in mice treated with cytostatic drugs."
True," The study provides primary data from an animal model of depression, specifically sepsis, with an appropriate control group and investigates the effects of sepsis on hepatic blood flow, cardiac output, and hepatocellular function."
False," The study does not investigate methods or models that induce depressive phenotype/s in vivo, but rather evaluates the effects of unilateral incarcerated inguinal hernia on testes in prepubertal rats."
False," The study does not investigate a model of depression or depressive-like phenotype in animals, but rather the effects of erythropoietin treatment on graft-versus-host reactivity and peripheral leukocytes in mice."
True,"<The study provides primary data of an animal model of depression with an appropriate control group, induced in a rat model of early life stress, and tests a treatment (venlafaxine) on depressive-like behavior and neural proliferation in the subventricular zone."
False," The abstract does not provide primary data of an animal model of depression or depressive-like phenotype, but rather investigates the effects of nitrovasodilators and guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate on vascular smooth muscle."
False," The article does not provide primary data of an animal model of depression or depressive-like phenotype with an appropriate control group, and it is focused on the electrophysiological effects of benzodiazepine antagonists rather than depression."
True," The study meets the inclusion criteria as it provides primary data of an animal model of a depressive-like phenotype, with an appropriate control group, and investigates the protective effect of deferoxamine on chromium(VI)-induced DNA single-strand breaks, cytotoxicity, and lipid peroxidation in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes."
