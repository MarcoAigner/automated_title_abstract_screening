methods: 42 chronic alcoholics were included in this prospective and randomized study. following the development of alcohol withdrawal syndrome, the patients were randomly allocated to the ghb or to the flunitrazepam group. in addition to this, clonidine was administered in order to treat autonomic signs of withdrawal. in cases were hallucinations occurred, haloperidol was administered.
results: there was no significant difference in the efficacy of treatment used in the duration of mechanical ventilation and intensive care unit stay between groups. the patients in the ghb-group required significantly higher dosages of haloperidol and significantly lower dosages of clonidine. 14 out of 21 patients from the ghb-group developed hypernatriaemia and 15 out of 21 developed a metabolic alkalosis.
conclusions: symptoms of the autonomic nervous system were more effectively prevented by ghb as evident in the lower dosage requirement of clonidine. however, ghb may not sufficiently block the hyperactivity of the dopaminergic system or may have an hallucinogenic effect itself. this may be evident from the higher dosages of haloperidol which were necessary. due to the latter fact, the administration of ghb cannot be recommended in all patients suffering from aws in icu settings.",Lenzenhuber E,1999,Anaesthesist,https://doi.org/10.1007/s001010050672,10093649,Lenzenhuber E; Müller C; Rommelspacher H; Spies C,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D004740: English Abstract; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000316: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; D000368: Aged; D000472: Alkalosis, Respiratory; D014151: Anti-Anxiety Agents; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D003000: Clonidine; D003422: Critical Care; D000431: Ethanol; D005260: Female; D005445: Flunitrazepam; D006220: Haloperidol; D006801: Humans; D006955: Hypernatremia; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D011446: Prospective Studies; D012978: Sodium Oxybate; D013375: Substance Withdrawal Syndrome",,,https://openalex.org/W177478450,148,12,1,1560,251,12

objective: the purpose of the present study was to determine the concentration-effect relationship of risperidone by assessing the eeg effect after oral administrations of single dose risperidone in healthy young males.
methods: nine healthy male volunteers received a 1 mg single oral dose of risperidone according to a placebo controlled crossover design. plasma levels of risperidone and its active metabolite 9-hydroxyrisperidone were measured by radioimmunoassay. quantitative eeg parameters were obtained for each of four frequency bands through spectral eeg analysis. the difference in the absolute power in the delta frequency band for the f3 lead between risperidone and placebo was used as a drug effect parameter. for pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling, the hypothetical effect compartment kinetically linked to plasma by a first-order process was postulated. all curve fittings were done with the non-linear curve-fitting program nonlin.
results: our results showed that absolute powers in delta and theta frequency bands were higher for risperidone administration than for placebo at all eeg leads, and the maximum effects were detected at about 3 h after administration of the drug. the hysteresis loop was observed in the plot of plasma concentration of risperidone or sum of risperidone and 9-hydroxyrisperidone (cp) versus eeg effect for each subject. a linear model adequately described the relationship between the effect compartment concentrations (ce) and eeg effects, and the two limbs of hysteresis in the cp-effect plot were collapsed in the ce-effect plot for risperidone or risperidone plus 9-hydroxyrisperidone.

methods: during a 2-day baseline phase with ad lib smoking, 91 non-depressed smokers (who were not trying to quit permanently) were administered measures of nicotine craving, withdrawal symptoms, and timed measures of cognitive performance five times daily. participants were then assigned randomly to a 14-day treatment regimen with bupropion 300 mg/day, bupropion 150 mg/day, or placebo. thereafter, the above measures were re-administered during 3 days of abstinence on a closed research ward.
results: relative to placebo, 300 mg bupropion significantly reduced abstinence-associated increases in rated depression, difficulty concentrating, and irritability, and attenuated a decrease in positive affect. the results also suggested that bupropion might have a positive effect on performance measures during the withdrawal period. no effects were observed on craving, anxiety, restlessness, or hunger. the lack of findings on craving measures may be explained by a floor effect; except on the first day of abstinence, neither drug nor placebo groups showed much craving elevation during abstinence.

false,moxonidine: some controversy,"initially it was considered that moxonidine, like clonidine, acted at central (2)-adrenoceptors to reduce blood pressure. with the characterisation of imidazoline binding sites distinct from (2)-adrenoceptors, the consensus became that moxonidine was acting predominantly at imidazoline i(1) receptors in the rostral ventrolateral medulla to lower blood pressure. moxonidine acts at prejunctional (2)-adrenoceptors on sympathetic nerve endings to decrease noradrenaline release and this may contribute to its ability to lower blood pressure. the predominant site of action of moxonidine may also depend on route of administration, with imidazoline i(1) receptors being predominant after central, and (2)-adrenoceptors predominant after systemic administration. the controversy over the mechanism and site of action with moxonidine is ongoing. in animal models, moxonidine lowers blood pressure, reduces cardiac hypertrophy and remodelling, reduces cardiac arrhythmias and increases blood flow in cerebral ischaemia. moxonidine also has beneficial effects in animal models of diabetes and kidney disease. moxonidine increases sodium and water excretion in rats, but not humans. animal studies indicate that moxonidine may be useful in the treatment of glaucoma by reducing intra-ocular pressure. animal studies show that moxonidine may also be effective in pain and in ethanol withdrawal. in humans, the pharmacokinetics of moxonidine are of the one-compartment model with first-order absorption. renal elimination is the major route of elimination and individual titration of moxonidine is needed in patients with renal impairment. there is overwhelming evidence that moxonidine is a safe and effective antihypertensive. a large clinical trial of moxonidine in heart failure, moxcon, was stopped because of excessive deaths in the moxonidine group. moxonidine should not be used in patients with heart failure, but there are no obvious reasons to stop its use as an antihypertensive, or its development for other clinical uses.",Doggrell SA,2001,Expert Opin Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1517/14656566.2.2.337,11336590,Doggrell SA,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000322: Adrenergic Agonists; D000818: Animals; D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D006333: Heart Failure; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D007093: Imidazoles; D054755: Imidazoline Receptors; D016032: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; D051381: Rats; D011955: Receptors, Drug; D013045: Species Specificity; D016896: Treatment Outcome",,,https://openalex.org/W2156576111,28,4,1,2027,333,15

objective: to compare ziprasidone im 2 mg (n=38) and 20 mg (n=41) in the acute control and short-term management of agitated psychotic patients.
methods: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 24-h study assessed efficacy using the behavioral activity rating scale (bars) and the panss. the bars is a validated rating scale for the assessment of treatment response in acute agitation associated with psychosis. following the initial dose, three more doses could be given 4 h apart if needed during the 24-h period.
results: the mean bars score had decreased 15 min after the first 20 mg im dose and was statistically significantly lower than the 2 mg group at 30 min post-dose. the improvement with the 20 mg dose increased until 2 h, and was maintained until at least 4 h post-dose (p<0.001). two hours after the first injection, almost all of the patients receiving ziprasidone 20 mg were bars responders compared with just one-third of those receiving 2 mg ziprasidone (p<0.001). the calming effect of ziprasidone was also evident by the significant reduction in panss agitation items (p<0.05) and cgi-severity at 4 h (p=0.008). both ziprasidone doses were very well tolerated. ziprasidone im 20 mg was not associated with eps, dystonia, akathisia, respiratory depression or with excessive sedation.
conclusions: ziprasidone im 20 mg substantially and significantly reduced the symptoms of acute agitation in patients with psychotic disorders. ziprasidone 20 mg im was very well tolerated and produced no dystonia or akathisia.",Daniel DG,2001,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s002130000658,11401000,Daniel DG; Potkin SG; Reeves KR; Swift RH; Harrigan EP,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016448: Multicenter Study; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000328: Adult; D017109: Akathisia, Drug-Induced; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007273: Injections, Intramuscular; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D010879: Piperazines; D011446: Prospective Studies; D011569: Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; D011595: Psychomotor Agitation; D011618: Psychotic Disorders; D013844: Thiazoles",,,https://openalex.org/W2158988332,137,22,1,1886,337,14

objective: given the successful use of sustained-release bupropion in treating nicotine dependence, this study investigated how maintenance on bupropion influenced symptoms of marijuana withdrawal compared to maintenance on placebo.
methods: marijuana smokers (n=10) were maintained outpatient on active (300 mg/day) or placebo (0 mg/day) bupropion for 11 days, and were then maintained inpatient on the same bupropion dose for 17 days. for the first 4 inpatient days, participants smoked active marijuana [2.8% delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (thc)] 5 times/day. for the remaining inpatient days, participants smoked placebo marijuana (0.0% thc) 5 times/day. participants were then maintained outpatient on the alternate dose of bupropion for 11 days, followed by a second inpatient residential stay, paralleling the first. medication administration was double-blind. mood, psychomotor task performance, food intake, and sleep were measured daily during each inpatient phase. the order of active and placebo bupropion maintenance was counterbalanced between groups.
results: bupropion had few behavioral effects when participants smoked active marijuana. during placebo marijuana smoking, i.e., active marijuana withdrawal, ratings of irritability, restlessness, depression, and trouble sleeping were increased by bupropion compared to placebo maintenance.

false,dropout rates in randomised antipsychotic drug trials,"rationale: it has been assumed that new atypical drugs improve treatment compliance due to fewer adverse effects. data supporting this assumption are scarce.
objectives: the aim of this study was to study attrition rates in randomised controlled trials of oral administration of conventional antipsychotic drugs, atypical antipsychotic drugs and placebo.
methods: the database of the schizophrenia module of the cochrane library was utilised for the present study. the data in the cochrane module are collected by identifying relevant randomised controlled trials from several electronic databases and other sources. number of dropouts was defined as patients leaving the study preterm due to any reason.
results: data from 328 treatment groups, consisting of 18,585 randomised subjects from 163 drug trials, were entered in the analysis. one-third of the subjects had dropped out of the trials. the dropout rates significantly increased for each calendar year. year of trial publication, type of drug and trial length remained statistically significant contributors to dropout rates. in a model incorporating year of publication and trial length, placebo groups and groups treated with conventional antipsychotics had significantly higher attrition rates than groups treated with atypical drugs. when clozapine-treated groups were excluded from the analysis, no statistically significant advantage for atypical drugs over conventional drugs remained.
conclusions: trial data implicate that a better compliance can be achieved by favouring atypical drugs rather than conventional alternatives in the treatment of schizophrenia. however, this effect is found only when groups treated with the atypical antipsychotic clozapine are included in the analysis. our study did not find evidence for a statistically significant superiority in acceptability of novel atypical drugs when compared to conventional antipsychotics.",Wahlbeck K,2001,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s002130100711,11432684,Wahlbeck K; Tuunainen A; Ahokas A; Leucht S,article,D016428: Journal Article; D017418: Meta-Analysis,"D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D016208: Databases, Factual; D006801: Humans; D010352: Patient Dropouts; D016032: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; D012107: Research Design",,,https://openalex.org/W1981210131,53,7,1,1921,299,15

false,loss of dopamine transporters in methamphetamine abusers recovers with protracted abstinence,"methamphetamine is a popular drug of abuse that is neurotoxic to dopamine (da) terminals when administered to laboratory animals. studies in methamphetamine abusers have also documented significant loss of da transporters (used as markers of the da terminal) that are associated with slower motor function and decreased memory. the extent to which the loss of da transporters predisposes methamphetamine abusers to neurodegenerative disorders such as parkinsonism is unclear and may depend in part on the degree of recovery. here we assessed the effects of protracted abstinence on the loss of da transporters in striatum, in methamphetamine abusers using positron emission tomography and [(11)c]d-threo-methylphenidate (da transporter radioligand). brain da transporters in five methamphetamine abusers evaluated during short abstinence (<6 months) and then retested during protracted abstinence (12-17 months) showed significant increases with protracted abstinence (caudate, +19%; putamen, +16%). although performance in some of the tests for which we observed an association with da transporters showed some improvement, this effect was not significant. the da transporter increases with abstinence could indicate that methamphetamine-induced da transporter loss reflects temporary adaptive changes (i.e., downregulation), that the loss reflects da terminal damage but that terminals can recover, or that remaining viable terminals increase synaptic arborization. because neuropsychological tests did not improve to the same extent, this suggests that the increase of the da transporters was not sufficient for complete function recovery. these findings have treatment implications because they suggest that protracted abstinence may reverse some of methamphetamine-induced alterations in brain da terminals.",Volkow ND,2001,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.21-23-09414.2001,11717374,Volkow ND; Chang L; Wang GJ; Fowler JS; Franceschi D; Sedler M; Gatley SJ; Miller E; Hitzemann R; Ding YS; Logan J,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D018848: Controlled Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000328: Adult; D019969: Amphetamine-Related Disorders; D002421: Caudate Nucleus; D002531: Cerebellum; D050483: Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008562: Membrane Glycoproteins; D026901: Membrane Transport Proteins; D008694: Methamphetamine; D008774: Methylphenidate; D009419: Nerve Tissue Proteins; D009483: Neuropsychological Tests; D011699: Putamen; D013997: Time Factors; D014055: Tomography, Emission-Computed",,,https://openalex.org/W2144176813,92,11,1,1812,288,9

design: a simplified but realistic model of physician behaviour and patient response was developed as a decision tree and populated with data derived from the available published clinical comparative trials. we considered patients with spasticity caused by multiple sclerosis or spinal cord injury. the outcome measure used was 'cost per successfully treated day' (std). costs were estimated from the perspective of the uk national health service at 2000 values.
results: expected cost for a cohort of 100 patients over 1 year was estimated to be pound 181 545 with baclofen and pound 211 930 with tizanidine. the estimated number of stds was 20,192 with tizanidine and 17,289 with baclofen. the overall cost effectiveness of managing spasticity using baclofen and tizanidine was very similar ( pound 10.50 and pound 10.49 per std respectively). the incremental cost effectiveness (ice) of using tinzanidine as an alternative to baclofen for first-line treatment was pound 10.47 per std. sensitivity analysis found the model to be robust to changes in key parameters

false,the effects of methylphenidate on prepulse inhibition during attended and ignored prestimuli among boys with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder,"rationale and objectives: the present study investigated attentional modification of prepulse inhibition of startle among boys with and without attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). two hypotheses were tested: (1) whether adhd is associated with diminished prepulse inhibition during attended prestimuli, but not ignored prestimuli, and (2) whether methylphenidate selectively increases prepulse inhibition to attended prestimuli among boys with adhd.
methods: participants were 17 boys with adhd and 14 controls. participants completed a tone discrimination task in each of two sessions separated by 1 week. adhd boys were administered methylphenidate (0.3 mg/kg) in one session and placebo in the other session in a randomized, double-blind fashion. during each series of 72 tones (75 db; half 1200-hz, half 400-hz), participants were paid to attend to one pitch and ignore the other. bilateral eyeblink electromyogram startle responses were recorded in response to acoustic probes (50-ms, 102-db white noise) presented following the onset of two-thirds of tones, and during one-third of intertrial intervals.
results: relative to controls, boys with adhd exhibited diminished prepulse inhibition 120 ms after onset of attended but not ignored prestimuli following placebo administration. methylphenidate selectively increased prepulse inhibition to attended prestimuli at 120 ms among boys with adhd to a level comparable to that of controls, who did not receive methylphenidate.

false,cognitive enhancing effects of modafinil in healthy volunteers,"rationale: modafinil, a novel wake-promoting agent, has been shown to have a similar clinical profile to that of conventional stimulants such as methylphenidate. we were therefore interested in assessing whether modafinil, with its unique pharmacological mode of action, might offer similar potential as a cognitive enhancer, without the side effects commonly experienced with amphetamine-like drugs.
objectives: the main aim of this study was to evaluate the cognitive enhancing potential of this novel agent using a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests.
methods: sixty healthy young adult male volunteers received either a single oral dose of placebo, or 100 mg or 200 mg modafinil prior to performing a variety of tasks designed to test memory and attention. a randomised double-blind, between-subjects design was used.
results: modafinil significantly enhanced performance on tests of digit span, visual pattern recognition memory, spatial planning and stop-signal reaction time. these performance improvements were complemented by a slowing in latency on three tests: delayed matching to sample, a decision-making task and the spatial planning task. subjects reported feeling more alert, attentive and energetic on drug. the effects were not clearly dose dependent, except for those seen with the stop-signal paradigm. in contrast to previous findings with methylphenidate, there were no significant effects of drug on spatial memory span, spatial working memory, rapid visual information processing or attentional set-shifting. additionally, no effects on paired associates learning were identified.
conclusions: these data indicate that modafinil selectively improves neuropsychological task performance. this improvement may be attributable to an enhanced ability to inhibit pre-potent responses. this effect appears to reduce impulsive responding, suggesting that modafinil may be of benefit in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder.",Turner DC,2003,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1250-8,12417966,Turner DC; Robbins TW; Clark L; Aron AR; Dowson J; Sahakian BJ,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D001559: Benzhydryl Compounds; D001794: Blood Pressure; D003071: Cognition; D003657: Decision Making; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D006339: Heart Rate; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008568: Memory; D000077408: Modafinil; D018696: Neuroprotective Agents; D010147: Pain Measurement; D010364: Pattern Recognition, Visual; D011581: Psychological Tests",,,https://openalex.org/W66447799,62,8,1,1979,312,14

objectives: this study aimed to investigate the effects of stimulant medications on the eeg of children with the combined subtype of adhd.
method: an initial eeg was recorded during an eyes-closed resting condition and fourier transformed to provide absolute and relative power estimates for the delta, theta, alpha and beta bands. theta/alpha and theta/beta ratios were also calculated. subjects were placed on a 6-month trial of a stimulant and a second eeg was recorded at the end of the trial.
results: the adhd group had significantly greater absolute delta and theta, less posterior absolute beta, more relative theta, and less relative alpha than the control group, which is typical of eeg studies of children with adhd. the use of stimulant medications resulted in normalisation of the eeg, primarily evident in changes in the theta and beta bands.

false,efficacy of newer generation antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia,"the advent of the newer 'atypical' antipsychotic medications has revolutionized the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. in contrast to the older conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical medications have a broader spectrum of efficacy (greater efficacy in negative, cognitive, and mood symptoms) and a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) and tardive dyskinesia. due to concerns surrounding hematological safety and other adverse effects, clozapine is used principally in patients refractory to treatment with other antipsychotic agents. the other three universally available atypical agents (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) collectively constitute about 70% of all antipsychotic prescriptions in the usa. despite the broad popularity of these medications and their rapid adoption in general clinical practice, there are limited data on how they compare to each other with regards to their overall efficacy and also as to their efficacy in specific symptom domains. to address this question, two separate analyses were undertaken. first, all published, short-term, randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were reviewed and the extent of improvement across these agents was compared. while the amount of improvement with a particular agent across its different studies varied, the average improvement was similar for the agents for all efficacy parameters considered. secondly, all randomized, controlled clinical trials directly comparing two or more of these agents in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were analyzed. only three such trials (all industry sponsored) were identified; while there were differences in methodology and small differences in efficacy on a minority of measures on which comparisons were undertaken, the preponderance of data suggested no differences in efficacy. while data thus far do not support assertions of differential efficacy between risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, there are clear differences in their side-effect profiles and these are briefly summarized.",Tandon R,2003,Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0306-4530(02)00110-5,12504069,Tandon R; Jibson MD,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D006801: Humans; D012559: Schizophrenia; D012565: Schizophrenic Psychology,,,https://openalex.org/W2127126926,77,10,1,2138,337,11

false,bupropion for the treatment of tobacco dependence,"tobacco use, particularly cigarette smoking, is now a global pandemic. the expected morbidity and mortality from smoking-attributable diseases will continue to rise for the next 30 years. in order to reduce this negative impact on worldwide health, effective therapy to aid smoking cessation must be provided to current smokers. treatment for tobacco dependence involves the combination of behavioural therapies and pharmacological treatment. the most common pharmacological treatments include nicotine replacement therapy and non-nicotine medications, including antidepressants. the antidepressant with the greatest weight of evidence for efficacy in the treatment of tobacco dependence is bupropion. sustained-release bupropion is approved for the treatment of tobacco dependence in over 50 countries worldwide. the efficacy of bupropion for the treatment of tobacco dependence is attributed to the blockage of dopamine reuptake in the mesolimbic dopaminergic system. this area of the brain is believed to mediate reward for nicotine use and for other drugs of dependence. randomised, controlled clinical trials have shown that bupropion approximately doubles abstinence rates compared with placebo. in addition, long-term treatment with bupropion may reduce or delay smoking relapse. bupropion also appears to be effective in the treatment of smokers who have recently relapsed and smokers with other comorbid psychiatric conditions. bupropion has a good adverse events profile, but the risk exists for serious adverse effects such as seizures. recent postmarketing surveillance reports have raised safety concerns about bupropion, although no causal relationship between bupropion and the reported serious adverse events or death has been established.",Hays JT,2003,CNS Drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/00023210-200317020-00001,12521356,Hays JT; Ebbert JO,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454: Review","D018687: Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; D016642: Bupropion; D006801: Humans; D018570: Risk Assessment; D016540: Smoking Cessation; D014029: Tobacco Use Disorder",,,https://openalex.org/W2122522992,49,7,1,1755,267,14

objective: to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three dosing strategies for switching chronic, stable patients with schizophrenia from current oral antipsychotic monotherapy to once-daily oral aripiprazole monotherapy.
method: patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient study were randomized to: 1). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off current antipsychotic over 2 weeks; or 3). up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. efficacy assessments included panss, cgi-s, and cgi-i scores. safety assessments included: adverse events (aes) recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), vital signs, ecg, and clinical laboratory tests.
results: efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three groups. the overall incidence of aes was broadly comparable across all groups, and aes were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited. discontinuations due to aes were comparable across the groups. no deterioration in eps occurred in any group. the reduction in body weight and plasma prolactin levels following switch to aripiprazole were comparable across the three groups.

false,measurement of simple reaction time in antipsychotic treatment of patients with schizophrenia,"background: the role of simple reaction time in schizophrenia has been extensively reported to date in professional literature. however, most studies have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single measurement. the aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia.
methods: seventeen in-patients suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (dsm iv criteria) and twenty matched, healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. the patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4 mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at a fixed dosage in the first week and thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. since no differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls. psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the positive and negative symptom scale (panss) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the simpson angus scale and abnormal involuntary movement scale. reaction time was measured with the alpha apparatus, connected to a personal computer. all assessments and measurements were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study.
results: the reaction time of patients was significantly longer than that of the healthy controls (t1 = 17.11; p1 < 0.05). after eight weeks of treatment the reaction time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). furthermore, the improved reaction time in the patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or with improved extrapyramidal symptoms.

false,"differential sensitivity to acute administration of ritalin, apormorphine, sch 23390, but not raclopride in mice selectively bred for hyperactive wheel-running behavior","rationale: previous studies of mice ( mus domesticus) selectively bred for high voluntary wheel running have suggested that the hyperactivity is associated with dysfunction in the dopaminergic neuromodulatory system and that high-running mice may represent a useful genetic model for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd).
objectives: we tested the hypothesis that mice from the four replicate hyperactive lines would respond differently to methylphenidate (ritalin), apomorphine (non-selective dopamine agonist), sch 23390 (selective d1-like dopamine antagonist), and raclopride (selective d2-like dopamine antagonist) than individuals from the four replicate, randomly bred, control lines.
methods: after animals were habituated (3 weeks) to their cages with attached wheels, drugs were administered via intraperitoneal injections, at night, during peak wheel-running activity. revolutions on wheels 10-70 min post-injection were used to quantify drug responses.
results: ritalin (15 mg/kg and 30 mg/kg) increased wheel running in control lines but decreased running in selected lines. a low-dose (0.125 mg/kg) of apomorphine reduced wheel running by a similar amount in control and selected lines; however, higher doses of apomorphine (0.25 mg/kg and 0.5 mg/kg) produced greater reductions in wheel running in the control lines. sch 23390 (0.025, 0.05, and 0.1 mg/kg) caused greater reductions in wheel running in control than in selected lines. raclopride (0.5, 1, and 2 mg/kg) reduced wheel running by a similar amount in control and selected lines.
conclusions: these results support the interpretation that genetically determined hyperactive wheel-running behavior is associated with altered dopaminergic function in this mouse model. more specifically, results suggest that d1-like (d1 or d5), but not d2-like (d2, d3, or d4), dopamine receptors have reduced function in the high-running mice. the fact that ritalin decreased wheel running in selected lines further supports their use as an animal model of adhd.",Rhodes JS,2003,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-003-1399-9,12669177,Rhodes JS; Garland T,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D021461: Animals, Outbred Strains; D001058: Apomorphine; D001552: Benzazepines; D001947: Breeding; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D018491: Dopamine Agonists; D018492: Dopamine Antagonists; D018765: Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005260: Female; D006948: Hyperkinesis; D008297: Male; D008774: Methylphenidate; D051379: Mice; D009043: Motor Activity; D020891: Raclopride; D012641: Selection, Genetic; D013045: Species Specificity; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2150568116,168,24,1,2034,350,11

objective: this 5-week, randomized, open-label study evaluated three strategies for switching patients from methylphenidate, a commonly used psychostimulant, to modafinil.
methods: patients ( n=40) with excessive daytime sleepiness related to narcolepsy, who had received previous treatment with methylphenidate, were switched from methylphenidate to modafinil (200 mg/day followed by 400 mg/day) without a washout period between treatments, with a 2-day washout period between treatments, or by using a taper-down/titrate-up protocol. adverse events were recorded throughout the study, and epworth sleepiness scale scores were determined at the end of the study.
results: the majority of patients (95%) were successfully switched to modafinil. at the study end point, mean epworth sleepiness scale scores were <12 for each treatment group. all three switching strategies were well tolerated, with adverse events mild or moderate in nature. adverse events most frequently reported during modafinil treatment were among those seen previously in large-scale, placebo-controlled studies. there were no meaningful differences among the treatment groups in the frequency or severity of adverse events or in their relationship to modafinil treatment. only one patient discontinued modafinil treatment because of a treatment-related adverse event (i.e. moderate headache); another patient discontinued due to insufficient efficacy.

false,relative lack of cognitive effects of methylphenidate in elderly male volunteers,"rationale: methylphenidate, a dopaminergic and noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor, has been shown in young, healthy adult volunteers to produce pronounced effects on working memory and sustained attention. we were interested in assessing whether similar improvements could be conferred upon elderly volunteers in order to gain a more complete understanding of the effects of age on monoaminergic manipulations of working memory and attention, as well as to explore the potential for pharmacological intervention in attention and executive dysfunction disorders in this age group.
objectives: the main aim of the study was to characterise the dose-related effects of methylphenidate on a range of neuropsychological functions in elderly healthy volunteers.
methods: sixty healthy elderly adult male volunteers received either a single oral dose of placebo, 20 mg or 40 mg methylphenidate prior to performing a variety of tasks designed to assess memory, attention and executive function. a randomised double-blind, between-subjects design was used.
results: methylphenidate had significant cardiovascular and subjective effects. however, unlike in younger volunteers, no significant effects of drug on working memory (spatial span and spatial working memory), response inhibition (stop-signal) or sustained attention (rapid visual information processing) were seen. subtle effects on latency similar to those in younger volunteers were identified: both doses of methylphenidate resulted in a slowing in response time during set-shifting and decision-making.
conclusions: the results of this study demonstrate that, in elderly subjects, the cognitive effects of methylphenidate are grossly attenuated and distinct from the profile previously described in younger volunteers. it is suggested that methylphenidate may not be appropriate as a pharmacological intervention in elderly patient groups, such as those reporting age-related cognitive decline.",Turner DC,2003,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-003-1457-3,12734634,Turner DC; Robbins TW; Clark L; Aron AR; Dowson J; Sahakian BJ,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000284: Administration, Oral; D000367: Age Factors; D000368: Aged; D002320: Cardiovascular Physiological Phenomena; D002490: Central Nervous System; D003071: Cognition; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008774: Methylphenidate; D008875: Middle Aged; D009483: Neuropsychological Tests; D010147: Pain Measurement; D011930: Reaction Time; D012307: Risk Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2013449353,80,11,1,1950,303,10

false,reduction in excess daytime sleepiness by modafinil in patients with myotonic dystrophy,"patients with myotonic dystrophy frequently suffer from excess daytime sleepiness, which can be a significant cause of disability. previous studies have indicated that this excess daytime sleepiness is only occasionally due to obstructive sleep apnoea and may be principally of central nervous system origin. modafinil has been successfully used to treat narcolepsy, a central disorder causing excess daytime sleepiness. we have investigated the use of this drug in myotonic dystrophy patients with excess daytime sleepiness. patients were recruited from a clinic population on the basis of screening with the epworth sleepiness scale. patients scoring 10 and above were invited to participate in a randomized double-blind crossover trial of modafinil versus placebo, with four weeks in each arm of the study separated by a 2-week washout period. patients were assessed by polysomnography at baseline. the primary outcome measures were change in both the epworth sleepiness scale and a modified maintenance of wakefulness test, which were measured at the start of each arm of the trial and in week 3 of each intervention period. in agreement with previous smaller studies, sleepiness is not correlated with ctg expansion size. treatment with modafinil showed a non-significant reduction in median epworth sleepiness scale. however, the median maintenance of wakefulness test score was prolonged by treatment (31.7-40 min, p=0.006). there were no significant adverse cardiac effects of the drug in this group of patients (resting 12 lead and 24 h ecg monitoring). selected patients with myotonic dystrophy and excess daytime sleepiness may benefit from modafinil. in this patient group the epworth sleepiness scale may not be the most reliable measure of sleepiness. despite the potential for cardiac disease in these patients, the drug was well tolerated with no adverse effects.",Talbot K,2003,Neuromuscul Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0960-8966(03)00030-0,12798791,Talbot K; Stradling J; Crosby J; Hilton-Jones D,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D001559: Benzhydryl Compounds; D000697: Central Nervous System Stimulants; D018592: Cross-Over Studies; D006970: Disorders of Excessive Somnolence; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D000077408: Modafinil; D009223: Myotonic Dystrophy; D009483: Neuropsychological Tests; D017286: Polysomnography; D011795: Surveys and Questionnaires; D016896: Treatment Outcome,,,https://openalex.org/W2047057465,87,12,1,1879,311,15

false,dose-related prolongation of tetracaine spinal anesthesia by oral clonidine in humans,"comment: clonidine and dexmedetomidine are nonspecific and specific a-2 receptor agonists that decrease the release of norepinephrine by stimulation of presynaptic sympathetic neurons. they decrease sympathetic activity in the central nervous system and reduce minimum alveolar concentration (mac) of inhalational anesthetics. this study has shown that oral clonidine prolongs the sensory block of spinal anesthesia obtained with tetracaine. the authors argue that this probably occurs through undefined supraspinal mechanisms. clonidine did not alter the maximum sensory level of spinal anesthesia but did significantly prolong the two- and four-dermatome regression time. it is interesting that the only significant hemodynamic effect seen was significantly decreased heart rate in patients receiving 300 μg, the highest dose used in the study. the protocol used in this study for patients undergoing vaginal hysterectomy or transurethral resection of the prostate is different than that used by most practitioners. isobaric spinal anesthesia was administered with 15 mg of tetracaine to patients averaging 5 foot 3 inches tall. the average sensory level obtained, however, was t-8. blood pressures were monitored every 2 min for the first 10 min and then only every 10 min. the a-2 agonists may enhance spinal anesthesia through a number of mechanisms. it may be an analgesic effect in the central nervous system similar to the enhancement of mac. it is unlikely that the doses used in the study would lead to significant concentrations of clonidine in the cerebrospinal fluid. finally, spinal cord blood flow may be altered, slowing the elimination of tetracaine. experimentally, it would be interesting to see if small doses of intrathecal clonidine or dexmedetomidine alter analgesic effects of local anesthetics. clonidine is used clinically as an antihypertensive (catapres). anesthesiologists need to be concerned about the effect on mac and, now, duration of spinal anesthesia. these concerns do not warrant discontinuation of the antihypertensive. sudden discontinuation may result in a “withdrawal syndrome,” characterized by hypertension and tachycardia.‘",Ota K,1994,Anesth Analg,https://doi.org/10.1097/00132586-199506000-00032,7978436,Ota K; Namiki A; Iwasaki H; Takahashi I,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000284: Administration, Oral; D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000775: Anesthesia, Spinal; D001794: Blood Pressure; D003000: Clonidine; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004334: Drug Administration Schedule; D004357: Drug Synergism; D005260: Female; D006339: Heart Rate; D006801: Humans; D007045: Hysterectomy, Vaginal; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009407: Nerve Block; D011467: Prostate; D013748: Tetracaine; D001743: Urinary Bladder",,,https://openalex.org/W2017904992,85,11,1,2168,351,19

study design: thirty children, aged 6.4 to 16.4 years, with epilepsy and adhd were studied during a 4-month period. during the initial 2 months of the study, the children were treated with antiepileptic drugs (aeds) only, and for the remaining 2 months, methylphenidate was added at a morning dose of 0.3 mg/kg. they underwent neurologic assessment, brain computed tomography, iq testing, and assessment with the childhood behavior checklist at baseline before methylphenidate therapy. electroencephalography, aed determinations, and the continuous-performance task (cpt) test were done at baseline and after 2 months of methylphenidate therapy. a double-blind, crossover design was used to compare the effects of methylphenidate versus placebo on an electroencephalogram, aed levels, and the cpt. on the 2 days of testing, the child received aeds and a capsule containing either placebo or methylphenidate.
results: none of the 25 children of this sample who were seizure free had attacks while taking methylphenidate. of the 5 children with seizures, 3 had an increase in attacks, whereas the other 2 showed no change or a reduction. there were no significant changes in aed levels or electroencephalographic findings. methylphenidate benefited 70% of children according to parental report; methylphenidate also enhanced performance on the cpt. side effects of methylphenidate were mild and transient.

false,physostigmine prevents postanesthetic shivering as does meperidine or clonidine,"background postanesthetic shivering develops in as many as one half of patients recovering from isoflurane anesthesia. cholinergic stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and adrenal medulla by physostigmine enhances secretion of arginine vasopressin, epinephrine, and norepinephrine. because the hypothalamus is the dominant thermoregulatory controller in mammals, and these neurotransmitters may be involved in body temperature control, physostigmine administration may influence the incidence of shivering. accordingly, the authors tested the hypothesis that physostigmine administration inhibits postanesthetic shivering. its efficacy was compared with that of saline (negative control) and meperidine and clonidine (positive controls). methods sixty patients having surgery of the ear or nose were tested. general anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg propofol, 0.1 mg/kg vecuronium, and 1.5 microg/kg fentanyl and maintained with isoflurane (1.5 +/- 0.4%) in 70% nitrous oxide. at the end of surgery, the patients were randomly assigned to receive an intravenous bolus of 0.04 mg/kg physostigmine, isotonic saline, 0.5 mg/kg meperidine, or 1.5 microg/kg clonidine. heart rate, mean arterial blood pressure, oxygen saturation, visual analog pain score, temperature, and postanesthetic shivering were measured during recovery. results postanesthetic shivering occurred in 6 of 15 (40%) patients given saline. in contrast, postanesthetic shivering was significantly reduced in physostigmine-treated patients (1 of 15, or 7%) and was absent in patients given clonidine or meperidine. conclusions physostigmine inhibited shivering as well as did two established treatments, meperidine and clonidine. these data suggest that cholinergic systems contribute to the genesis and control of postanesthetic shivering.",Horn EP,1998,Anesthesiology,https://doi.org/10.1097/00000542-199801000-00018,9447863,Horn EP; Standl T; Sessler DI; von Knobelsdorff G; Büchs C; Schulte am Esch J,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000758: Anesthesia; D001794: Blood Pressure; D003000: Clonidine; D005260: Female; D006339: Heart Rate; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008614: Meperidine; D008875: Middle Aged; D010830: Physostigmine; D012768: Shivering,,,https://openalex.org/W1990679215,80,9,1,1824,288,13

method: the pharmacokinetics of two single therapeutic doses of olanzapine were determined in 11 healthy volunteers. the first dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was taken alone and the second dose (10 mg) after 2 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine (200 mg bid). measurement of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excretion was used as an endogenous marker to confirm that induction of cyp3a4 by carbamazepine had occurred.
results: the dose of olanzapine given after a 2-week pretreatment with carbamazepine was cleared more rapidly than olanzapine given alone. olanzapine pharmacokinetic values for cmax and auc were significantly lower after the second dose, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the clearance and volume of distribution were significantly increased.
conclusion: carbamazepine has been shown to induce several p450 cytochromes including cyp3a4 and cyp1a2. since cyp1a2 plays a role in the metabolic clearance of olanzapine, the interaction may be attributed to induction of cyp1a2 by carbamazepine, leading to increased first-pass and systemic metabolism of olanzapine. the interaction is not considered to be of clinical significance because olanzapine has a wide therapeutic index, and the changes in plasma concentration of olanzapine are within the fourfold variation that occurs without concern for safety in a patient population.",Lucas RA,1998,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s002280050527,9860152,Lucas RA; Gilfillan DJ; Bergstrom RF,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D018848: Controlled Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article,"D000284: Administration, Oral; D000293: Adolescent; D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D015415: Biomarkers; D002220: Carbamazepine; D051544: Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; D003577: Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; D004347: Drug Interactions; D006801: Humans; D006854: Hydrocortisone; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D006899: Mixed Function Oxygenases; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine",,,https://openalex.org/W2073975093,102,12,1,1823,287,10
