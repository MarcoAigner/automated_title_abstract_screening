false,strategies for better diabetes control in the us,"recent surveys in the us have indicated that 71% of the total diabetes care is delivered by primary care physicians, and that current management practices in terms of the point of initiation of pharmacological treatment fall considerably short of the american diabetes association's recommendations. in part, this delay in initiating treatment is due to a fear of provoking hypoglycaemia, which in itself results from a general avoidance of blood glucose monitoring on the part of patients. as a consequence of this apparent disregard for diabetes care, blood glucose concentrations are not adequately controlled in the us and this is reflected in a high incidence of chronic complications, particularly diabetic neuropathy. this is likely to have major cost implications in the future. in an effort to improve the standard of diabetes care, a number of us authorities have begun producing guidelines for primary care physicians, and in the state of texas, treatment algorithms that incorporate recommendations based on the current us registration trial data have been developed. these recommendations, which have now been adopted by the state of texas and form part of the minimum standard of care mandated by the state department of health's diabetes council, provide guidance on the selection and use of oral antidiabetic drugs (including sulphonylureas, metformin, troglitazone, repaglinide and acarbose) in patients with type 2 diabetes, both for glycaemic control and for prevention of cardiovascular complications. it is hoped that organised implementation of these treatment algorithms will produce better control of diabetes and its complications than the current ad hoc strategies used by individual practitioners.",Garber AJ,1999,Drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/00003495-199958001-00014,10576528,Garber AJ,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D002318: Cardiovascular Diseases; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D013781: Texas; D014481: United States",,,https://openalex.org/W1985941324,48,8,1,1724,285,7

false,economic assessment of troglitazone as an adjunct to sulfonylurea therapy in the treatment of type 2 diabetes,"to assess the economic efficiency of adding troglitazone to sulfonylurea therapy to improve glycemic control.despite the high prevalence of type 2 diabetes, existing treatment strategies often fail. new oral agents give a wider segment of the population with type 2 diabetes hope of achieving near-normal blood-glucose levels. troglitazone, a novel chemical entity, is one promising new agent.we conducted an economic analysis based on glycemic-control data from a randomized clinical trial comparing troglitazone with placebo, each added to glyburide. a patient simulation model was used to translate these data to long-term outcomes associated with diabetes. patients had poorly controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus despite glyburide therapy. risk functions of developing and progressing through nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy, hypoglycemia, and macrovascular disease were developed from the diabetes control and complications trial and large epidemiologic studies. cost estimates were based on data from 5 states, all payor databases, surveys, and literature. the main outcomes of the model were cost-consequences, number of patients developing each type of complication, mean time to development of the complication, cost per life-year gained (lyg), and cost per quality-adjusted life-year.the model predicts that for every 1000 patients treated with troglitazone, the improved glycemic control could mean that 95 to 140 fewer patients would experience one of the most severe diabetic complications (eg, blindness, end-stage renal disease, amputation), which may increase life expectancy by 2.0 years. these benefits are obtained at an additional $2100 per lyg (undiscounted). the ratio remains <$50,000 per lyg for most variations in input.the clinical trial demonstrated that troglitazone + glyburide improves glycemic control compared with glyburide alone. based on these results, the model estimates fewer diabetic complications at a cost well below accepted cost-effective thresholds.",Caro JJ,2000,Clin Ther,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0149-2918(00)87983-7,10688395,Caro JJ; Klittich WS; Raggio G; Kavanagh PL; O'Brien JA; Shomphe LA; Flegel KM; Copley-Merriman C; Sigler C,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D018848: Controlled Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D001786: Blood Glucose; D002839: Chromans; D015331: Cohort Studies; D003362: Cost-Benefit Analysis; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D016527: Drug Costs; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D018803: Models, Economic; D016032: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; D013453: Sulfonylurea Compounds; D013844: Thiazoles; D045162: Thiazolidinediones; D000077288: Troglitazone; D014481: United States",,,https://openalex.org/W2105964383,109,17,1,1998,320,11

true,mealtime glucose regulation by nateglinide in type-2 diabetes mellitus,"objectives: pharmacodynamic effects of nateglinide, a novel antidiabetic agent, were investigated in patients with type-2 diabetes mellitus.
methods: ten patients participated in this single-center, double-blind, crossover study. plasma glucose and insulin levels were measured over 24 h following five 7-day treatment periods with nateglinide (30, 60, or 120 mg) or placebo given three times daily before breakfast, lunch, and dinner. a fifth treatment consisted of 120 mg nateglinide four times daily, with the fourth dose given before an evening snack.
results: taken 10 min before meals, doses of 30-120 mg nateglinide caused dose-dependent increases in plasma insulin levels that were significantly greater than with placebo. higher doses were more effective and had a longer duration of action than lower doses. nateglinide was also significantly better than placebo in lowering plasma glucose levels; the 60-mg and 120-mg doses were similarly effective and superior to the 30-mg nateglinide treatment. following the fourth 120-mg dose, the glucose-lowering effects of treatment were maintained through the night. no serious adverse events occurred during the study. there were no events of hypoglycemia and no clinically meaningful changes in safety parameters.

true,a rational approach to drug therapy of type 2 diabetes mellitus,"several new pharmacological agents have recently been developed to optimise the management of type 2 (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. the aim of this article is to briefly review the various therapeutic agents available for management of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and to suggest a potential approach to drug selection. there are three general therapeutic modalities relevant to diabetes care. the first modality is lifestyle adjustments aimed at improving endogenous insulin sensitivity or insulin effect. this can be achieved by increased physical activity and bodyweight reduction with diet and behavioural modification, and the use of pharmacological agents or surgery. this first modality is not discussed in depth in this article. the second modality involves increasing insulin availability by the administration of exogenous insulin, insulin analogues, sulphonylureas and the new insulin secretagogue, repaglinide. the most frequently encountered adverse effect of these agents is hypoglycaemia. bodyweight gain can also be a concern, especially in patients who are obese. the association between hyperinsulinaemia and premature atherosclerosis is still a debatable question. the third modality consists of agents such as biguanides and thiazolidinediones which enhance insulin sensitivity, or agents that decrease insulin requirements like the alpha-glucosidase inhibitors. type 2 diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying pathophysiological processes. therapy should be individualised based on the degree of hyperglycaemia, hyperinsulinaemia or insulin deficiency. in addition, several factors have to be considered when prescribing a specific therapeutic agent. these factors include efficacy, safety, affordability and ease of administration.",Chehade JM,2000,Drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/00003495-200060010-00006,10929931,Chehade JM; Mooradian AD,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D005544: Forecasting; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D007328: Insulin",,,https://openalex.org/W2018194304,63,11,1,1804,271,15

true,pharmacology and clinical experience with repaglinide,"repaglinide (novonorm((r))) is a novel oral antidiabetic agent, the first of a new class of insulin secretagogues known as the prandial glucose regulators to be approved for use in patients with type 2 diabetes. prandial glucose regulation is aimed at restoring the first-phase insulin response that follows consumption of a meal, which is missing in patients with type 2 diabetes. after repaglinide administration, the resulting insulin profile reflects that of healthy individuals more closely, providing tighter glycaemic control and reducing the risk of hypoglycaemic events. repaglinide is quickly absorbed and rapidly eliminated through biliary excretion, making it suitable for use in patients with renal impairment. it appears in the bloodstream within 15 to 30 min of dosing, stimulating short-term insulin release from the pancreatic beta-cells by binding to a unique site on the beta-cell membrane. rapid elimination ensures that postprandial insulin levels quickly return to preprandial levels as the high prandial glucose level subsides. repaglinide is given on a 'one meal, one tablet; no meal, no tablet' basis. it is particularly effective in patients who have not previously been treated with an oral antidiabetic agent, significantly reducing glycosylated haemoglobin (hba(1c)) levels by 1.6%. it also offers increased mealtime flexibility and safety, compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. as a result of the short plasma half-life and lack of accumulation of repaglinide with repeated dosing, the risk of between-meal and nocturnal hypoglycaemia is substantially reduced compared with other oral antidiabetic agents. repaglinide acts synergistically with metformin, consistently improving glycaemic control in patients who were insufficiently controlled by metformin alone. results from recent studies have shown similar synergistic effects with neutral protamine hagedorn (nph)-insulin or troglitazone.",Massi-Benedetti M,2000,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,https://doi.org/10.1517/13543784.9.4.885,11060717,Massi-Benedetti M; Damsbo P,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000818: Animals; D002219: Carbamates; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D004435: Eating; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D010880: Piperidines",,,https://openalex.org/W2138804577,53,6,1,1930,316,12
true,management of type 2 diabetes mellitus and cardiovascular risk,"although the diagnosis of type 2 (noninsulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus is made when blood glucose levels exceed values which increase the risk of microvascular complications, macrovascular disease is the major complication of type 2 diabetes mellitus. both epidemiological and prospective data have demonstrated that treatment of hyperglycaemia is markedly effective in reducing the risk of microvascular disease but is less potent in reducing that of myocardial infarction, stroke and peripheral vascular disease. treatment of other cardiovascular risk factors, although by definition less prevalent than hyperglycaemia, appears to be more effective in preventing macrovascular disease than treatment of hyperglycaemia. in recent years, data from intervention trials have suggested that greater benefits with respect to the prevention of macrovascular disease can be achieved by effective treatment of hypertension and hypercholesterolaemia, and by the use of small doses of aspirin (acetylsalicylic acid) than by treating hyperglycaemia alone. on the other hand, the uk prospective diabetes study (ukpds), which examined the impact of intensive glucose and blood pressure (bp) control on micro- and macrovascular complications, is the only intervention trial to include only patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. the ukpds data, the epidemic increase in the number of patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus and their high cardiovascular risk have, however, initiated several new trials addressing, in particular, the possible benefits of treatment of the most common form of dyslipidaemia (high serum triglyceride and low high density lipoprotein cholesterol levels) in these patients. type 2 diabetes mellitus is thus a disease associated with a high vascular risk, where the majority of patients need, and are likely to benefit from, pharmacological treatment of several cardiovascular risk factors provided treatment targets have not been achieved by life-style modification.",Yki-Järvinen H,2000,Drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/00003495-200060050-00001,11129129,Yki-Järvinen H,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D002318: Cardiovascular Diseases; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D006801: Humans; D006949: Hyperlipidemias; D006973: Hypertension; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D008019: Life Style; D010975: Platelet Aggregation Inhibitors; D018570: Risk Assessment",,,https://openalex.org/W78898943,62,9,1,1985,316,7
true,recent advances in the pharmacologic management of diabetes mellitus,"the importance of glucose control in reducing the complications of diabetes mellitus has been clearly demonstrated. the emergency physician routinely is expected to treat a wide range of problems related to this disease, including making the initial diagnosis of type 2 and occasionally type 1 diabetes. also common are patients with poorly controlled diabetes. the recent introduction of new classes of agents to lower blood glucose, especially in type 2 diabetes, should improve the control in this category of patient and reduce the complication rate. some of these agents, such as troglitazone, have potentially fatal complications and require careful monitoring. emergency physicians should be aware of the common complications of these drugs because patients can present to the ed with them. hypoglycemia, a common cause of 911 calls and emergency visits, is not a side effect of either metformin or acarbose. insulin lispro has improved postprandial glycemic control for type 1 and some insulin-requiring type 2 diabetics. hypoglycemia is less of a risk with insulin lispro, and quality of life is better with this rapidly acting insulin. newer methods of insulin delivery, such as continuous subcutaneous infusion, have greatly improved glucose control, given greater freedom to patients, and reduced the risks of hypoglycemia.",Carlton FB,2000,Emerg Med Clin North Am,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0733-8627(05)70156-5,11130936,Carlton FB,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D020909: Acarbose; D000284: Administration, Oral; D002219: Carbamates; D002839: Chromans; D003920: Diabetes Mellitus; D062787: Drug Overdose; D004630: Emergencies; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D007328: Insulin; D061268: Insulin Lispro; D008687: Metformin; D010880: Piperidines; D013453: Sulfonylurea Compounds; D013844: Thiazoles; D045162: Thiazolidinediones; D000077288: Troglitazone",,,https://openalex.org/W1965420891,68,9,1,1335,225,10

false,clinical review of glimepiride,"this article reviews the pharmacological and clinical aspects of glimepiride, the latest second-generation sulfonylurea for treatment of type 2 diabetes mellitus (dm). glimepiride therapy ameliorates the relative insulin secretory deficit found in most patients with type 2 dm. it is a direct insulin secretagogue; indirectly, it also increases insulin secretion in response to fuels such as glucose. its action to augment insulin secretion requires binding to a high affinity sulfonylurea receptor, which results in closure of atp-sensitive potassium channels in the beta-cells of the pancreas. the question has been raised whether insulin secretagogues by acting on vascular or myocardial potassium channels may prevent ischaemic preconditioning, a physiological adaptation that could affect the outcome of coronary heart disease, but there is evidence against this concern being applicable to glimepiride. glimepiride's antihyperglycaemic efficacy is equal to other secretagogues. it has pharmacokinetic properties that make it less prone to cause hypoglycaemia in renal dysfunction than some other insulin secretagogues, particularly glyburide (also known as glibenclamide in europe). its convenient once daily dosing may enhance compliance for diabetic patients who often also require medications for other co-morbid conditions, such as hypertension, hyperlipidaemia and cardiac disease. glimepiride is approved for monotherapy, for combination with metformin and with insulin. clinically, its reduced risk of hypoglycaemia makes it preferable to some other insulin secretagogues when attempting to achieve recommended glycaemic control (haemoglobin a(1c) (hgba(1c)) 7%). using suppertime neutral protamine hagedorn (nph) and regular insulin with morning glimepiride in overweight diabetic patients achieves glycaemic goals more quickly than insulin alone and with lower insulin doses.",McCall AL,2001,Expert Opin Pharmacother,https://doi.org/10.1517/14656566.2.4.699,11336617,McCall AL,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; D016454: Review","D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D004347: Drug Interactions; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D013453: Sulfonylurea Compounds",,,https://openalex.org/W2099466477,30,4,1,1890,297,11

results: covariates found to have an influence on pk of rep include dose, gender. race, age, and weight. covariates affecting the glucose response included dose, gender, and weight. these differences are not expected to be clinically significant.

false,desensitization of insulin secretion,"desensitization of insulin secretion describes a reversible state of decreased secretory responsiveness of the pancreatic beta-cell, induced by a prolonged exposure to a multitude of stimuli. these include the main physiological stimulator, glucose, but also other nutrients like free fatty acids and practically all pharmacological stimulators acting by depolarization and ca2+ influx into the beta-cell. desensitization of insulin secretion appears to be an important step in the manifestation of type 2 diabetes and in the secondary failure of oral antidiabetic treatment. in this commentary, the basic concepts and the controversial issues in the field will be outlined. with regard to glucose-induced desensitization, two fundamentally opposing concepts have emerged. the first is that desensitization is the consequence of functional changes in the beta-cell that impair glucose-recognition. the second is that long-term increased secretory activity leads to a depletion of releasable insulin, often in spite of increased insulin synthesis. the latter concept is more appropriately termed beta-cell exhaustion. the same dichotomy applies to the desensitization evoked by pharmacological stimuli: again the relative contributions of a decreased insulin content versus alterations in signal transduction are in dispute. the action of tolbutamide on beta-cells may be an example of desensitization caused by a lack of releasable insulin since the signaling mechanisms are nearly unchanged, whereas the action of phentolamine, an imidazoline, induces a strong desensitization without reducing insulin content or secretory granules, apparently by abolishing ca2+ influx. with pharmacological agents it seems that both, alterations in signal transduction and decreased availability of releasable insulin, can contribute to the desensitized state of the beta-cell, the relative contribution being variable depending upon the exact nature of the secretory stimulus.",Rustenbeck I,2002,Biochem Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-2952(02)00996-6,12093468,Rustenbeck I,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454: Review","D000818: Animals; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D004734: Energy Metabolism; D005230: Fatty Acids, Nonesterified; D005947: Glucose; D006801: Humans; D007328: Insulin; D000078790: Insulin Secretion; D013453: Sulfonylurea Compounds",,,https://openalex.org/W2026241715,36,4,1,1963,298,11

false,effects of inhibition of atp-sensitive potassium channels on metabolic vasodilation in the human forearm,"experimental data suggest that vascular atp-sensitive potassium (katp) channels may be an important determinant of functional hyperaemia, but the contribution of katp channels to exercise-induced hyperaemia in humans is unknown. forearm blood flow was assessed in 39 healthy subjects (23 males/16 females; age 22±4 years) using the technique of venous occlusion plethysmography. resting forearm blood flow and functional hyperaemic blood flow (fhbf) were measured before and after brachial artery infusion of the katp channel inhibitors glibenclamide (at two different doses: 15 and 100µg/min) and gliclazide (at 300µg/min). fhbf was induced by 2min of non-ischaemic wrist flexion–extension exercise at 45 cycles/min. compared with vehicle (isotonic saline), glibenclamide at either 15µg/min or 100µg/min did not significantly alter resting forearm blood flow or peak fhbf. the blood volume repaid at 1 and 5min after exercise was not diminished by glibenclamide. serum glucose was unchanged after glibenclamide, but plasma insulin rose by 36% (from 7.2±0.8 to 9.8±1.3m-units/l; p = 0.02) and 150% (from 9.1±1.3 to 22.9±3.5m-units/l; p = 0.002) after the 15 and 100µg/min infusions respectively. gliclazide also did not affect resting forearm blood flow, peak fhbf, or the blood volume repaid at 1 and 5min after exercise, compared with vehicle (isotonic glucose). gliclazide induced a 12% fall in serum glucose (p = 0.009) and a 38% increase in plasma insulin (p = 0.001). thus inhibition of vascular katp channels with glibenclamide or gliclazide does not appear to affect resting forearm blood flow or fhbf in healthy humans. these findings suggest that vascular katp channels may not play an important role in regulating basal vascular tone or skeletal muscle metabolic vasodilation in the forearm of healthy human subjects.",Farouque HM,2003,Clin Sci (Lond),https://doi.org/10.1042/cs1040039,12519086,Farouque HM; Meredith IT,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000328: Adult; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005260: Female; D005542: Forearm; D005907: Gliclazide; D005905: Glyburide; D006801: Humans; D006940: Hyperemia; D008297: Male; D018482: Muscle, Skeletal; D010991: Plethysmography; D026902: Potassium Channel Blockers; D015221: Potassium Channels; D012039: Regional Blood Flow; D014664: Vasodilation",,,https://openalex.org/W1964487125,104,14,1,1828,321,11

false,molecular basis for kir6.2 channel inhibition by adenine nucleotides,"k(atp) channels are comprised of a pore-forming protein, kir6.x, and the sulfonylurea receptor, surx. interaction of adenine nucleotides with kir6.2 positively charged amino acids such as k185 and r201 on the c-terminus causes channel closure. substitution of these amino acids with other positively charged residues had small effects on inhibition by adenine nucleotide, while substitution with neutral or negative residues had major effects, suggesting electrostatic interactions between kir6.2 positive charges and adenine nucleotide negative phosphate groups. furthermore, r201 mutation decreased channel sensitivity to atp, adp, and amp to a similar extent, but k185 mutation decreased primarily atp and adp sensitivity, leaving the amp sensitivity relatively unaffected. thus, channel inhibition by atp may involve interaction of the alpha-phosphate with r201 and interaction of the beta-phosphate with k185. in addition, decreased open probability due to rundown or sulfonylureas caused an increase in atp sensitivity in the k185 mutant, but not in the r201 mutant. thus, the beta-phosphate may bind in a state-independent fashion to k185 to destabilize channel openings, while r201 interacts with the alpha-phosphate to stabilize a channel closed configuration. substitution of r192 on the c-terminus and r50 on the n-terminus with different charged residues also affected atp sensitivity. based on these results a structural scheme is proposed, which includes features of other recently published models.",Ribalet B,2003,Biophys J,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-3495(03)74847-4,12524280,Ribalet B; John SA; Weiss JN,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000227: Adenine Nucleotides; D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000596: Amino Acids; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005905: Glyburide; D006801: Humans; D015640: Ion Channel Gating; D007668: Kidney; D024661: Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; D011994: Recombinant Proteins; D012680: Sensitivity and Specificity; D014162: Transfection",,,https://openalex.org/W1985451719,68,9,1,1513,243,9

materials and methods: a literature-based, decision-tree model was developed to project the number of patients achieving glycosylated haemoglobin values of <7% on oral therapies and the associated costs over a 3-year timeframe. for each first-line strategy, patients could progress to combination therapy using two or more agents prior to the introduction of insulin. the overall cost of treatment included costs (2001/2002 values; us dollars) of comprehensive medical care, laboratory tests, patient education, drug therapy, home glucose monitoring and adverse events.
results: at 3 years, the overall cost of treatment for the various first-line strategies was 6,106 us dollars for glipizide gastrointestinal therapeutic system, 6,727 us dollars for metformin immediate release, 6,826 us dollars for metformin extended release, 7,141 us dollars for glibenclamide (glyburide)/metformin, 7,759 us dollars for rosiglitazone and 9,298 us dollars for repaglinide. costs of comprehensive routine medical care ranged from approximately 1,538-2,128 us dollars in year 1 and from approximately 952-1,543 us dollars in subsequent years, for controlled and uncontrolled patients, respectively. adverse events represented <1%, and drug therapies represented approximately 50%, of the overall cost, respectively. substantial cost differences between the strategies were seen within the first year. regardless of first-line therapy, patients progressed quickly to combination therapies, with effectiveness among the agents being similar.
conclusions: short-term costs required to provide comprehensive diabetes care and achieve glycemic goals can be substantial. the model suggests a sulphonylurea strategy may provide similar effectiveness with cost savings over other agents and should be considered when selecting an initial drug therapy in newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus.",Ramsdell JW,2003,Pharmacoeconomics,https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-200321110-00005,12859222,Ramsdell JW; Braunstein SN; Stephens JM; Bell CF; Botteman MF; Devine ST,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D002219: Carbamates; D015331: Cohort Studies; D003663: Decision Trees; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D004180: Direct Service Costs; D016527: Drug Costs; D004359: Drug Therapy, Combination; D005913: Glipizide; D005905: Glyburide; D006442: Glycated Hemoglobin; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D008329: Managed Care Programs; D008390: Markov Chains; D008687: Metformin; D018803: Models, Economic; D010880: Piperidines; D000077154: Rosiglitazone; D013844: Thiazoles; D045162: Thiazolidinediones; D014481: United States",,,https://openalex.org/W2049679961,129,18,1,2121,331,11

false,acute effects of glyburide on the regulation of peripheral blood flow in normal humans,"recent animal studies have demonstrated that selective blockade of atp-sensitive k+ (katp) channels of vascular smooth muscle results in a significant increase in peripheral vascular tone. the main aim of this study was to assess whether glyburide, a selective blocker of katp channels and commonly used antidiabetic agent, influences resting blood flow and reactive hyperemic response of peripheral tissues of normal subjects. baseline calf blood flow was measured non-invasively in six normal subjects with femoral venous occlusive plethysmography. calf blood flow was also serially measured every 30–60 s after the release of calf arterial occlusion (10 min duration). reactive hyperemia was expressed in terms of peak post-occlusive flow, duration of hyperemia and reactive hyperemic volume. in each subject, baseline flow and reactive hyperemia were measured before (control) and every hour for 5 h after the oral ingestion of either 7.5 mg glyburide or a placebo on two separate days. baseline calf flow declined by 30 and 42% of control values after 1 and 2 h of glyburide intake (p < 0.05) with a return to control values by hours 3, 4 and 5. peak post-occlusive flow after 1, 2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was lower than control values by 22, 30 and 28%, respectively (p < 0.05). the duration of reactive hyperemia after 2 and 3 h of glyburide ingestion was significantly longer than control values (p < 0.05), whereas reactive hyperemic volume remained unaffected by glyburide intake. placebo elicited no significant changes in baseline flow or reactive hyperemia throughout the 5-h experimental period. these results indicate that a single dose of glyburide in the therapeutic range elicits significant alterations in the regulation of peripheral blood flow in normal subjects. we propose that these alterations are mediated through the blockade of vascular smooth muscle katp channels.",Kosmas EN,1995,Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(94)00732-m,7768272,Kosmas EN; Levy RD; Hussain SN,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000284: Administration, Oral; D000328: Adult; D018592: Cross-Over Studies; D005268: Femoral Vein; D005905: Glyburide; D006801: Humans; D006940: Hyperemia; D007866: Leg; D008297: Male; D010991: Plethysmography; D012016: Reference Values; D012039: Regional Blood Flow",,,https://openalex.org/W2085561130,86,14,1,1900,333,12

false,new treatments for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus,"summary in subjects with type 2 diabetes, both defects of insulin secretion and insulin resistance contribute to the development of hyperglycaemia. the major goals of treatment are to optimise blood glucose control, and normalise the associated lipid disturbances and elevated blood pressure. pharmacologic treatment is often necessary. this paper discusses new forms of oral treatment for subjects with type 2 diabetes. these include a new sulphonylurea compound glimepiride (amaryl), which binds to a different protein of the putative sulphonylurea receptor than glibenclamide, and seems to have a lower risk of hypoglycaemia. a new class of drugs with insulin secretory capacity, of which repaglinide (novonorm) is the leading compound, is now in phase iii clinical trials. alpha-glucosidase inhibitors reversibly inhibit alpha-glucosidase enzymes in the small intestine, which delays cleavage of oligo- and disaccharides to monosaccharides. this leads to a delayed and reduced blood glucose rise after a meal. two compounds are in development or have been marketed, ie, miglitol and acarbose (glucobay). another new class of drugs is the thiazolidine-diones, which seem to work by enhancing insulin action. the ‘insulin sensitising’ effects of the leading compounds, troglitazone and brl 49653c, do not involve any effect on insulin secretion. these drugs also seem to beneficially influence serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels. oral antihyperglycaemic agents can be used only during a limited period of time in most patients, after which the diabetic state ‘worsens’ and insulin therapy has to be started. in this light, two new forms of treatment which require subcutaneous injections are also discussed: the synthetic human amylin analogue ac137 (pramlintide) and glucagon-like peptide-1 (7-36)-amide, a strong glucose-dependent stimulator of insulin secretion. it remains to be seen whether these compounds can be developed further for clinical use in patients with diabetes.",Wolffenbuttel BH,1996,Postgrad Med J,https://doi.org/10.1136/pgmj.72.853.657,8944206,Wolffenbuttel BH; Graal MB,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000682: Amyloid; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D005934: Glucagon; D052216: Glucagon-Like Peptide 1; D065089: Glycoside Hydrolase Inhibitors; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D007328: Insulin; D007333: Insulin Resistance; D000078790: Insulin Secretion; D058228: Islet Amyloid Polypeptide; D010446: Peptide Fragments; D011498: Protein Precursors; D013453: Sulfonylurea Compounds",,,https://openalex.org/W2135084189,57,9,1,1989,336,15

false,pathophysiology of type 2 diabetes and modes of action of therapeutic interventions,"at least 90% of the 12 to 15 million persons with diabetes mellitus in the united states, half of whose condition remains undiagnosed, have type 2 diabetes. type 2 diabetes is preceded by a long period of impaired glucose tolerance, a reversible metabolic state associated with increased prevalence of macrovascular complications. thus, at the time of diagnosis, long-term complications have developed in almost one fourth of patients. susceptibility to type 2 diabetes requires genetic (most likely polygenic) and acquired factors, and its pathogenesis involves an interplay of progressive insulin resistance and beta-cell failure. the ideal treatment of type 2 diabetes should reverse insulin resistance and beta-cell dysfunction in most treated patients and prevent, delay, or reverse long-term complications. current strategies are aimed at amelioration of insulin resistance (diet, exercise, weight loss, and metformin and troglitazone therapy), augmentation of insulin supply (sulfonylurea and insulin therapy), or limitation of postprandial hyperglycemia (acarbose therapy). future therapies probably will target (1) insulin resistance, using a multifaceted approach; (2) hepatic glucose production, using gluconeogenesis inhibitors; (3) excess nonesterified fatty acid production, using lipolysis inhibitors; and (4) fat oxidation, using carnitine palmitoyltransferase i and ii inhibitors. attempts also could be made to stimulate energy expenditure and increase nonoxidative glucose disposal by means of β3-adrenoceptor agonists. one promising strategy is an attack on multiple pathophysiological processes by combining antidiabetic agents with disparate mechanisms of action. thus, we now have unprecedented resources for drug therapy for diabetes, with great opportunity for innovative combinations. it is hoped that these expanded choices will provide the tools necessary for a more efficient management of type 2 diabetes and prevention of its long-term complications. arch intern med. 1997;157:1802-1817",Dagogo-Jack S,1997,Arch Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.1997.00440370028004,9290539,Dagogo-Jack S; Santiago JV,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D004359: Drug Therapy, Combination; D005947: Glucose; D006801: Humans; D006943: Hyperglycemia; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D008099: Liver",,,https://openalex.org/W2124095103,83,12,1,2017,329,13

methods: twelve healthy male subjects were included in this double-blind cross-over study and received a single 1.75-mg dose of glibenclamide on the 8th day of continuous administration of either placebo (reference) or voglibose 5 mg t.i.d. (test). blood samples were taken to determine the pharmacokinetic characteristics of glibenclamide and the test/reference ratios were evaluated according to bioequivalence criteria. additional blood samples were taken to measure serum glucose on the same day.
results: the concentration-time course of glibenclamide under concomitant voglibose administration was similar to that under placebo. the equivalence ratio (test/reference) for the pharmacokinetic characteristics aucnorm was 1.03 (geometric mean; 0.95-1.11, 90% confidence interval) and cmax.norm 1.01 (0.94-1.08). the parameters were within the accepted range of 0.8-1.25 (auc) or 0.7-1.43 (cmax), thus fulfilling equivalence criteria and indicating no effect of voglibose on glibenclamide kinetics. the glibenclamide-induced decrease in fasting serum glucose concentration was similarly independent of placebo or voglibose co-administration.
