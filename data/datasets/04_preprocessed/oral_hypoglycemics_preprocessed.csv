5,false,Evaluation of the Potential Clinical and Economic Effects of Bodyweight Stabilisation with Acarbose in Patients with Type Diabetes Mellitus,Bodyweight is an acknowledged independent risk factor for coronary heart disease CHD The present model analysis was undertaken to investigate the clinical and economic impact of bodyweight gain in patients with type noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus and its effects on the development of CHD Based on a retrospective reevaluation of data from the Diabetes Intervention Study DIS patients with type diabetes mellitus and stable bodyweight group A had a significantly lower rate of combined CHD events than patients showing a bodyweight gain group B over years Prevention of bodyweight gain therefore appears to be a meaningful strategy in the management of diabetes mellitus In addition to this clinical advantage prevention of CHD will also result in economic savings associated with avoided treatment of coronary events Based on the clinical outcomes from the DIS the calculated perpatient net savings for a patient with type diabetes mellitus and stable bodyweight amounted to deutschmarks DM when compared with a patient experiencing a bodyweight increase In a further step the above situation was projected to current type diabetes mellitus practice Oral firstline treatment of type diabetes mellitus is usually initiated with glibenclamide glyburide which is known to increase bodyweight reflecting group B The novel alphaglucosidase inhibitor acarbose in contrast appears to be as effective as glibenclamide but has the advantage of being bodyweightneutral reflecting group A From the clinical viewpoint acarbose can thus be considered an alternative to glibenclamide From the viewpoint of drug costs monotherapy with acarbose is times as expensive as glibenclamide in Germany resulting in perpatient incremental costs of DM for acarbose over years Balanced against the potential year cost saving of DM resulting from the potential of acarbose to prevent CHD around onethird of the incremental cost of acarbose may be recouped by this single effect However further possible benefits of acarbose including the avoidance of hypoglycaemia and the deferral of costly insulin therapy may improve the economic value of this novel antidiabetic agent Given the indirect approach of this evaluation and its many limitations the above findings need critical appraisal and comparative trials are urgently required to substantiate our preliminary results,Banz K,1998,Pharmacoeconomics,https://doi.org/10.2165/00019053-199813040-00007,10178668,Banz K; Dinkel R; Hanefeld M; Schwanebeck U,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D020909: Acarbose; D000328: Adult; D001835: Body Weight; D003661: Decision Support Techniques; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D014312: Trisaccharides",,,https://openalex.org/W2040971139,141,20,1,2461,418,14,en,en

82,true,A Rational Approach to Drug Therapy of Type Diabetes Mellitus,Several new pharmacological agents have recently been developed to optimise the management of type noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus The aim of this article is to briefly review the various therapeutic agents available for management of patients with type diabetes mellitus and to suggest a potential approach to drug selection There are three general therapeutic modalities relevant to diabetes care The first modality is lifestyle adjustments aimed at improving endogenous insulin sensitivity or insulin effect This can be achieved by increased physical activity and bodyweight reduction with diet and behavioural modification and the use of pharmacological agents or surgery This first modality is not discussed in depth in this article The second modality involves increasing insulin availability by the administration of exogenous insulin insulin analogues sulphonylureas and the new insulin secretagogue repaglinide The most frequently encountered adverse effect of these agents is hypoglycaemia Bodyweight gain can also be a concern especially in patients who are obese The association between hyperinsulinaemia and premature atherosclerosis is still a debatable question The third modality consists of agents such as biguanides and thiazolidinediones which enhance insulin sensitivity or agents that decrease insulin requirements like the alphaglucosidase inhibitors Type diabetes mellitus is a heterogeneous disease with multiple underlying pathophysiological processes Therapy should be individualised based on the degree of hyperglycaemia hyperinsulinaemia or insulin deficiency In addition several factors have to be considered when prescribing a specific therapeutic agent These factors include efficacy safety affordability and ease of administration,Chehade JM,2000,Drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/00003495-200060010-00006,10929931,Chehade JM; Mooradian AD,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D005544: Forecasting; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D007328: Insulin",,,https://openalex.org/W2018194304,63,11,1,1804,271,15,en,en

402,true,Pharmacokinetics of Oral Antihyperglycaemic Agents in Patients with Renal Insufficiency,This paper reviews the effects of renal insufficiency on the pharmacokinetics of oral antidiabetic drugs Of the groups of drugs currently available for the treatment of noninsulindependent diabetes mellitus NIDDM the sulphonylureas and metformin are in general welltolerated and generally safe In patients with chronic renal insufficiency however care must be exercised in the use of many of these drugs as accumulation either of the active drug or of active metabolites can lead to serious adverse effects such as hypoglycaemia or with metformin lactic acidosis The sulphonylurea drugs to a greater or lesser degree are metabolised in the liver to a variety of active or inactive compounds which in general are excreted by the kidneys In addition varying amounts of parent compound may depend on renal elimination As a result sulphonylurea drugs such as tolazamide acetohexamide chlorpropamide and glibenclamide glyburide are more likely to cause significant hypoglycaemia as the metabolism of these drugs compared with other commonly prescribed sulphonylureas can lead to the accumulation of either the parent drug or the active metabolite in the presence of renal insufficiency Tolbutamide glipizide gliclazide and gliquidone are much less likely to cause hypoglycaemia as their metabolites are either inactive or have minimal hypoglycaemic potency Metformin is dependent on renal excretion and is not significantly metabolised As a result caution is required when treating patients with renal insufficiency where metformin accumulation can occur with the danger of lactic acidosis Although the correlation between creatinine clearance CLCR and total oral clearance of drug is weaker than the correlation between CLCR and renal clearance CLR of metformin it is clear that renal insufficiency is associated with most cases of metformininduced lactic acidosis For this reason clinicians in general would regard a raised plasma creatinine as a contraindication to metformin treatment Acarbose an alphaglucosidase inhibitor and a relatively new agent for treating NIDDM is likely to be safe in patients with impaired renal function as the drug is not significantly absorbed from the gut but data on this subject are lacking,Harrower AD,1996,Clin Pharmacokinet,https://doi.org/10.2165/00003088-199631020-00003,8853933,Harrower AD,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D020909: Acarbose; D000284: Administration, Oral; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D008687: Metformin; D051437: Renal Insufficiency; D013453: Sulfonylurea Compounds; D014312: Trisaccharides",,,https://openalex.org/W2089225574,87,10,1,2281,388,12,en,en

451,false,Die Stellung der Biguanide in der Therapie des Diabetes mellitus,BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES Biguanides have been used in treatment of diabetes mellitus for over years now Due to frequent occurrence of lactic acidosis particularly in patients with serious contraindications to biguanide therapy and in cases of noncompliance with dosage instructions buformin and phenformin were taken off the market in most European countries at the end of the seventies Metformin continued to be allowed since the risk of lactic acidosis is times less than with phenformin or buformin due to the different pharmacokinetic properties of the substance Plenty of clinical experience has been gained with metformin documented in a large number of reliable longterm studies FINDINGS Metformin lowers fasting blood glucose levels by an average of to postprandial blood glucose by up to and HbAc bei to Metformin reduces raised plasma insulin levels in cases of metabolic syndrome by as much as and reduces the insulin requirement of type insulintreated diabetics by to It has well documented effects on various rheological parameters In overweight type diabetics metformin shows the same level of hypoglycaemic effect as all of the important sulfonylurea derivatives used in Europe The active mechanism of these derivatives is however concentrated solely on reduction of blood glucose This mechanism does not take into account the remaining risk constellation involved in insulin resistance Biguanides similarly to weight reduction lead to a reduction of hyperinsulinaemia which is by contrast exacerbated by sulfonylureas and in particular exogenous insulin CONCLUSION The risk of lactic acidosis can probably be eliminated entirely if dosage instructions and contraindications are observed carefully The cause of such neglect in of all cases was limited on renal function serum creatinine mg Regarding morbidity and mortality from lactic acidosis metformin therapy is no riskier than treatment with the sulfonylurea derivative glibenclamide taking into account the incidence of fatal hypoglycaemias with the latter,Haupt E,1997,Med Klin (Munich),https://doi.org/10.1007/bf03044916,9340472,Haupt E; Panten U,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D001645: Biguanides; D001786: Blood Glucose; D000075202: Contraindications; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D007333: Insulin Resistance; D008687: Metformin",,,https://openalex.org/W49811413,64,10,1,2136,367,13,de,en
