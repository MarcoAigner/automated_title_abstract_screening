711,false,Ethnic Differences in Use of Antipsychotic Medication Among Texas Medicaid Clients With Schizophrenia,Article AbstractBackground Culture and ethnicity have been suggested to influence the presentation of patients with schizophrenia These factors are thought to affect the diagnoses courses of treatment and medical utilization patterns of patients with schizophrenia Specifically the differences between whites African Americans and Mexican Americans are of particular importance as these groups comprise the majority of the population in the United States today The traditional course of treatment for many patients with schizophrenia is the drug haloperidol However research has shown that some ethnic groups African Americans and Mexican Americans may respond better to atypical drugs such as olanzapine but may be less likely to receive these drugs A better response to the course of treatment results in improved medical utilization patterns The purpose of this study was to examine if ethnicity helped predict whether Texas Medicaid patients were prescribed haloperidol versus olanzapine when other factors were controlled for Method The study population consisted of patients whose index drug was haloperidol and patients whose index drug was olanzapine Patients had an ICDCM diagnosis of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder Texas medical and prescription claims data were used in a logistic regression analysis to determine significant predictors of the type of antipsychotic haloperidol vs olanzapine patients were prescribed Variables included in the analysis were ethnicity gender age region other mental illness comorbidities and previous utilization of medications and resources Data were collected from Jan to Aug Results The results show that when other demographic and utilization factors were controlled for African Americans were less likely than whites to receive olanzapine rather than haloperidol Conclusion Ethnicity is a significant predictor of the type of antipsychotic that is prescribed,Opolka JL,2003,J Clin Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.4088/jcp.v64n0603,12823076,Opolka JL; Rascati KL; Brown CM; Barner JC; Johnsrud MT; Gibson PJ,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000328: Adult; D001741: Black or African American; D000368: Aged; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D004363: Drug Utilization; D005260: Female; D006220: Haloperidol; D006630: Hispanic or Latino; D006801: Humans; D016015: Logistic Models; D008297: Male; D008484: Medicaid; D008875: Middle Aged; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine; D012559: Schizophrenia; D013781: Texas; D044465: White People,,,https://openalex.org/W2001604573,101,13,1,1987,321,14,en,en

1117,true,Efficacy and extrapyramidal sideeffects of the new antipsychotics olanzapine quetiapine risperidone and sertindole compared to conventional antipsychotics and placebo A metaanalysis of randomized controlled trials,The objective of this metaanalysis is to summarize the efficacy and tolerability of the new antipsychotics risperidone olanzapine sertindole and quetiapine in schizophrenia compared to placebo and conventional antipsychotics The main results are All of the new drugs are more effective than placebo but the magnitude of the effect is only moderate mean effect size r of all antipsychotics vs placebo with a confidence interval CI n According to the studies published to date sertindole and quetiapine are as effective as haloperidol and risperidone and olanzapine are slightly more effective than haloperidol in the treatment of global schizophrenic symptomatology With respect to negative symptoms all new antipsychotics are more effective than placebo However contrary to widespread opinion so is the conventional antipsychotic haloperidol Risperidone and olanzapine are slightly superior sertindole is as effective andaccording to the only study fully published to datequetiapine is even slightly less effective than haloperidol in this regard All new antipsychotics are associated with less frequent use of antiparkinson medication than haloperidol with risperidone appearing to have a slightly less favourable EPSprofile than the other new antipsychotics The methodological limitations of this review the generalizability of the results and expectations from future research are discussed,Leucht S,1999,Schizophr Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0920-9964(98)00105-4,9988841,Leucht S; Pitschel-Walz G; Abraham D; Kissling W,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D017418: Meta-Analysis,D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001480: Basal Ganglia Diseases; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D003987: Dibenzothiazepines; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D006220: Haloperidol; D006801: Humans; D007093: Imidazoles; D007211: Indoles; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine; D000069348: Quetiapine Fumarate; D016032: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; D018967: Risperidone; D012559: Schizophrenia,,,https://openalex.org/W2109481947,219,29,2,1470,245,8,en,en
