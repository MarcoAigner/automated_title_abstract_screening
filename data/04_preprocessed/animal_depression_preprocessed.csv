true,,"aim: to demonstrate the effect of nimesulide in reversing reserpine induced depression in mice.materials and methods: this test was done using 20-25gm of healthy albino mice of either sex in the department of pharmacology of gauhati medical college.they were housed in standard laboratory condition at 25ºc and fed on standard diet and water ad libitum.five groups were selected each containing six mice.the groups were group i (normal control), group ii (disease control), group iii (fluoxetine 10mg/kg i.p),group iv ( nimesulide 2.5mg/kg i,p) and group v (nimesulide 5mg/kg i.p)reserpine (2mg/kg i.p) was used to induce depression in all the groups except the normal control.after 24 hours, the standard and test drugs were given and the mice were subjected to tail suspension test (tst) after 30 mins and forced swim test (fst) after 1 hour of injecting the drugs.result: mean±sem values were calculated for each group.the data were analyzed using anova and post analysis was done by dunnett's test.results were found to be significant (p<.05).the period of immobility was found to be reduced in the test groups in a dose dependent manner as compared to the disease control .however, the episodes and the duration of immobility was minimum in the standard group.conclusion: nimesulide has been found to be effective in reversing reserpine induced depression in mice.",,,,https://doi.org/10.13040/ijpsr.0975-8232.7(1).336-39,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/W4248972341,0,0,0,1369,249,1
true,behavioural and neuroendocrine effects of aqueous extract of boerhaavia diffusa linn. in mice using tail suspension and forced swim tests--a preliminary study.,"the present study was done to evaluate the effect of aqueous extract of b. diffusa on depression in mice using behavioral models such as tail suspension test (tst) and forced swim test (fst). the extract (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, po) was administered for 14 successive days to swiss young albino mice. on 14th day, 60 min after administration, mice were subjected to tst and fst. the administration of aqueous extract of b. diffusa (50, 100 and 200 mg/kg, po) significantly decreased immobility period in both tst and fst, indicating significant antidepressant-like activity. the lowest dose (50 mg/kg) of the extract decreased the immobility period most significantly in fst, showing most potent antidepressant-like action. the efficacy of the extract (50 mg/kg) was comparable to fluoxetine (20 mg/kg). the extract did not show any significant effect on locomotor activity. the extract showed significant monoamine oxidase -a inhibitory activity. there was no significant effect of the extract on plasma corticosterone levels. prazosin (alpha1-adrenoceptor antagonist), sulpiride (selective d2-receptor antagonist), baclofen (gaba(b) agonist), and p-cpa (tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor) significantly attenuated the extract-induced antidepressant-like effect, when tested in tst. the extract might produce antidepressant-like effect by interaction with alpha1-adrenoceptors, dopamine-d2 receptors, serotonergic, and gaba(b) receptors. thus, aqueous extract of b. diffusa showed significant antidepressant-like activity in mice probably through involvement of monoaminergic and gabaergic systems.",,,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/W2418627755,159,26,2,1597,276,12
false,social isolation-induced epigenetic changes in midbrain of adult mice.,"social isolation and loneliness increase the risk of death as much as well-established risk factors for mortality such as cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption. the underlying molecular mechanisms are poorly understood. in the present study, 3 months old male c57bl/6 mice were socially isolated by individual housing for another 3 months. at the age of 6 months, epigenetic changes were analyzed in midbrain. social isolation of male adult mice led to an increased global dna methylation, which was associated with enhanced activity of dna methyltransferase. di- and trimethylation of global histone h3 lysine 4 (h3k4) were increased in midbrain of socially isolated mice, accompanied by enhanced h3k4 histone methyltransferase activity. in addition, social isolation of adult mice led to activation of histone acetyltransferases as well as of histone deacetylases (hdac) resulting in a net enhancement of histone h3 lysine 9 (h3k9) acetylation. gene-specific effects were observed for hdac1, hdac3 and the serotonin transporter slc6a4. social isolation led to an up-regulation of hdac1 and hdac3, associated with decreased dna methylation in the cpg island of the respective genes. on the contrary, the slc6a4 gene was down-regulated, which was associated with enhanced dna methylation. collectively, the results from the present study demonstrate for the first time that social isolation of adult mice leads to a wide range of global epigenetic changes and these effects may have profound impact on gene expression pattern and phenotype of the socially isolated animals.",,,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/W2161753516,70,10,1,1577,264,11
true,antidepressant and anxiolytic activities of bio flavonoid-gossypin,"summary gossypin is a bioflavonoid compound and is found in various herbs, especially in malvaceae family. the pharmacological properties of gossypin have been rarely reported with the exception of its antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activity. the purpose of this study was to characterize the putative anxiolytic-like properties and antidepressant activity using an elevated plus maze (epm), light –dark test forced swim test, chronic mild stress (cms) and sedative property by pentobarbitone induced sleeping time. control mice were treated with an equal volume of vehicle (saline 0.9% w/v), and positive control mice were treated with diazepam (1 mg/kg). all the test drugs were administered orally. gossypin (20mg/kg) significantly increase the time spent in open arms of epm test (p< 0.01). in the light-dark test, gossypin significantly increased the time spent in light space at 20mg/kg (p<0.01). the antidepressant effect was supported by the forced swim test, gossypin (20mg/kg) significantly shortened the immobility time and the effect was comparable to imipramine (20mg/kg) (p<0.01). in the cms test, mice were subjected to cms exhibited as reduction in sucrose intake, the reversal of the intake has been shown by gossypin (20mg/kg) in 21 days treatment, which was comparable to amytriptaline (20mg/kg) (p<0.01). at higher doses, a sedative effect produced by acute administration of gossypin (20mg/kg) was indicated by the potentiation of pentobarbital induced sleep. the present results shows the anxiolytic profile and antidepressant effect of gossypin.",,,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/W2188415357,66,7,1,1571,288,11
false,[inhibitory monoamine oxidases of the new generation].,"this review deals with the new generation of selective and partly reversible monoamine oxidase (mao) inhibitors. in contrast to the non selective inhibitors, used in the year 1957-1970, the selective inhibitors bind to and block only one of the two isoenzymes, mao-a or mao-b. the mao-a inhibitors and part of the mao-b inhibitors differ also from the classic drugs by their reversibility. the inhibition of mao-a cause the rise of norepinephrine, dopamine and serotonin in the synaptic cleft, of mao-b only of dopamine. the new inhibitors diminish also to some extent the reuptake of monoamines. the molecular action mechanism of the new drug generation is the same as in the non-selective drugs: increase of monoamines, near to the receptor, leads, after a number of intermediate steps, to activation of functional proteins in the cell. the selective block of one of the isoenzymes does not stop the metabolism of tyramine (from cheese, red wine), because this toxic compound is metabolised by both isoenzymes. the control of therapy with mao-a inhibitors is easier, because of their reversibility. selective inhibitors of mao have found a secure place in therapy of depression (inh. of mao-a, esp. moclobemide) and parkinson's disease (inh. of mao-b, at this time mainly selegiline). discussed is possible use of selective mao-inhibitors for achieving an increase in cognitive function and protections of neurone cells from biochemical lesions.",,,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/W53920622,54,10,1,1447,263,13

false,effects of electroconvulsive shock on monoaminergic systems in the rat brain. thesis.,"the effects of single or repeated electroconvulsive shock (ecs) (once daily for 7 days) on rat behavior and on the level, utilization and uptake of biogenic amines in rat brain were studied between one and ten days after the last ecs. it has been found that a single ecs caused catalepsy and analgesia, depressed locomotor activity and locomotor hypermotility produced by amphetamine and nomifensine (but not by apomorphine) and decreased the frequency of head twitch response evoked by licl. repeated ecs also induced catalepsy and analgesia but enhanced both the spontaneous locomotor activity and amphetamine, nomifensine and apomorphine-induced hypermotility, and increased the frequency of head twitch response produced by licl, 5-htp and 5-methoksytryptamine. single and repeated ecs did not change exploratory motility or stereotyped behavior induced by apomorphine, but enhanced haloperidol-induced catalepsy and altered dopamine and serotonin levels in the rat brain. the utilization of na and da was not changed by repeated ecs, whereas the uptake of these amines was slightly reduced. the present results provide evidence that a single ecs depresses but repeated ecs augments some behavioral responses to dopaminergic and serotonergic agonists. the possible biochemical mechanisms involved in these effects of ecs are discussed.",,,,,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/W2410472284,85,14,2,1339,217,7

false,regulation of testosterone biosynthesis in rat testes by 7 alpha-hydroxylated c 19  steroids.,"abstract 7α-hydroxyandrostenedione and 7α-hydroxytestosterone inhibited the transformation, in vitro , of pregnenolone to progesterone by the δ 5 -3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase coupled with the δ 5 -δ 4 isomerase in rat testicular microsomal fraction (10000–105000 × g precipitate). the inhibition by the 7α-hydroxylated steroids on the enzyme system was competitive, and the inhibitor constant was estimated to be 56 μm for 7α-hydroxyandrostenedione and 385 μm for 7α-hydroxytestosterone. substrate constants for the δ 5 -3β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase for pregnenolone were 67 and 64 μm, respectively, in the presence of 7α-hydroxyandrostenedione and 7αhydroxytestosterone. 7α-hydroxytestosterone inhibited the testicular 7α-hydroxylase activity, but not significantly the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase, whereas 7αhydroxyandrostenedione inhibited both enzymic activities. other testicular enzymic activities related to steroid metabolism, such as the testicular 17α-hydroxylase, c 17 -c 20 -lyase and 20α-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase were not influenced in vitro by the two 7α-hydroxylated steroids. when 7α-hydroxyandrostenedione was incubated with subcellular fractions of rat testes, no metabolite other than 7α-hydroxytestosterone was obtained. when the testicular microsomal fraction suspended in 0.25 m sucrose solution was stored at 0°, the activity of the 17β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase decreased nearly exponentially with the time of storage, but the activity of 7α-hydroxylase remained without decrease up to the 5th day of storage. from the results obtained, the possibility of an intracellular regulation of testosterone production by 7α-hydroxylation and its 7α-hydroxylated steroids is proposed.",Inano H,1971,Biochim Biophys Acta,,5113505,Inano H; Tamaoki BI,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D015068: 17-Ketosteroids; D000731: Androstanes; D000818: Animals; D002458: Cell Fractionation; D002474: Cell-Free System; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004355: Drug Stability; D006908: Hydroxyprogesterones; D006913: Hydroxysteroid Dehydrogenases; D007535: Isomerases; D008190: Lyases; D008297: Male; D008660: Metabolism; D008861: Microsomes; D008928: Mitochondria; D006899: Mixed Function Oxygenases; D011284: Pregnenolone; D011374: Progesterone; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains; D013256: Steroids; D013347: Subcellular Fractions; D013737: Testis; D013739: Testosterone; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2082027613,93,14,1,1719,242,8
false,reactivity of chick embryo heart to cholinergic agonists during ontogenesis: decline in desensitization at the onset of cholinergic transmission.,"acetylcholine, acetyl-β-methylcholine and carbamylcholine inhibited sinoatrial pacemaker activity in atria isolated from chick embryos on the 6th, 12th and 18th incubation days. cardioinhibition persisted throughout the 5-minute exposure to cholinergic agonists in sinoatrial preparations from the 12th and l8th incubation days whereas automaticity recovered completely within 1 to 2 minutes in preparations from the 6th incubation day. neither hydrolysis by acetylcholinesterase nor release of catecholamines from cardiac stores accounted adequately for the brevity of pacemaker inhibition by choline esters on the 6th incubation day. evidence suggested that desensitization, most prominently observed with carbamylcholine, restricted the duration of cholinergic inhibition of the pacemaker on the 6th incubation day. although automaticity recovered completely within 2 minutes after initial application of acetylcholine and carbamylcholine, pacemaker cells were not inhibited by a second application until the tissues had been bathed in drug-free saline for 10 to 20 minutes. the decline in desensitization may be due to developmental changes in the atropine-sensitive cholinergic receptor and/or in the potassium conductance activatd by the drug-receptor interaction. the ontogenetic decline in desensitization occurred around the time that cholinergic transmission to the sinoatrial pacemaker appeared (12th incubation day) and reactivity of the pacemaker to cholinergic agonists increased. like skeletal muscle, chick embryo atria underwent a change in reactivity to tetrodotoxin and to cholinergic agonists at the time of cholinergic innervation.",Pappano AJ,1974,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,4371671,Pappano AJ; Skowronek CA,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000109: Acetylcholine; D000110: Acetylcholinesterase; D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D001285: Atropine; D002217: Carbachol; D002395: Catecholamines; D002642: Chick Embryo; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D003888: Desensitization, Immunologic; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D006321: Heart; D006584: Hexamethonium Compounds; D008688: Methacholine Compounds; D010138: Pacemaker, Artificial; D010275: Parasympathetic Nervous System; D010277: Parasympathomimetics; D010830: Physostigmine; D011188: Potassium; D011433: Propranolol; D011941: Receptors, Adrenergic; D012849: Sinoatrial Node; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013779: Tetrodotoxin; D013997: Time Factors; D014403: Tubocurarine",,,https://openalex.org/W1865964546,145,21,1,1652,237,8
false,modulation of immunosuppression in obstructive jaundice by tinospora cordifolia.,"a clinical study was undertaken to determine the immune status of patients with obstructive jaundice. screening of 16 patients for phagocytic and microbicidal activity of polymorphonuclear cells (pmn) revealed a significant depression (21.2 +/- 3.7% phagocytosis and 20.85 +/- 4.5% intracellular killing) of these functions, as compared to normal values (30.37 +/- 5.1% and 26.41 +/- 4.3% respectively). an animal model of cholestasis was also established, using rats, in which a significant depression of activity of pmn and peritoneal macrophages was observed. these cellular abnormalities were found to precede and predispose to infection. the rats also showed an increased susceptibility to escherichia coli infection (mortality rate 77.78%). a defect was detected in their serum responsible for depressing the function of phagocytic cells. an attempt was made to improve this immunosuppression by treating the rats with water extract of t. cordifolia 100 mg/kg for 7 days, following development of cholestasis. the extract improved the cellular immune functions. mortality rate following esch. coli infection was significantly reduced to 16.67 per cent. this study showed that cholestasis results in immunosuppression and therefore indicates the need for an immunomodulator in management of obstructive jaundice. the plant t. cordifolia seems to meet this need by consolidating host defence mechanism.",Rege NN,1989,Indian J Med Res,,2697692,Rege NN; Nazareth HM; Bapat RD; Dahanukar SA,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000818: Animals; D002779: Cholestasis; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004927: Escherichia coli Infections; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007108: Immune Tolerance; D007194: India; D008297: Male; D008515: Medicine, Ayurvedic; D008875: Middle Aged; D010946: Plants, Medicinal; D051381: Rats",,,https://openalex.org/W2410639483,80,10,1,1406,233,12
false,studies concerning the mechanism of suppression of renin secretion by clonidine.,"two series of experiments were performed in anesthetized dogs to test the hypothesis that the suppression of renin secretion by clonidine results from a centrally mediated decrease in the activity in the renal sympathetic nerves. in the first series, clonidine (1 mug/kg) was administered directly into the third ventricle of a group of dogs in which renal perfusion pressure was controlled by adjusting an aortic clamp. in these animals, clonidine produced hypotension and bradycardia and suppressed plasma renin activity to 39 percent of the control value. these changes in blood pressure and plasma renin activity were closely correlated. intraventricular clonidine produced similar alterations in blood pressure and heart rate in another group of dogs in which renal perfusion pressure was not controlled, but failed to suppress plasma renin activity. in the second series of experiments, clonidine was administered intravenously in a dose of 30 mug/kg. intravenous clonidine produced a transient hypertension followed by hypotension, decreased heart rate and suppressed plasma renin activity to 49 percent of the control value. renal denervation reduced renin secretion and prevented the suppression of renin secretion produced by intravenous clonidine. thus, these data are consistent with the hypothesis that the suppression of renin secretion by clonidine results from a centrally mediated decrease in renal sympathetic neural tone. this suppression may be overcome by large falls in renal perfusion pressure.",Reid IA,1975,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,1120965,Reid IA; MacDonald DM; Pachnis B; Ganong WF,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002552: Cerebral Ventricles; D003000: Clonidine; D003714: Denervation; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004285: Dogs; D006339: Heart Rate; D007016: Hypophysectomy; D007267: Injections; D007275: Injections, Intravenous; D007668: Kidney; D008297: Male; D010902: Pituitary Gland; D011188: Potassium; D012083: Renin; D012964: Sodium",,,https://openalex.org/W2260029760,80,12,1,1517,242,10

false,different glutamate receptor mechanisms in long-term depression induced by different stimulus patterns in the ca1 area of adult rat hippocampus.,"previous reports suggested that a novel stimulus pattern of multi-train stimulus at low-frequency (2-hz or 5-hz) could induce stable long-term depression (ltd) in the ca1 area of adult rat hippocampus. in the present study, in order to determine the mechanism in ltd induced by the two novel tetanus patterns, changes in the population spikes (ps) in the hippocampal ca1 area of adult rats following the multi-train stimulus in the presence of ap5 [antagonist of n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors (nmdars)] or mcpg [antagonist of type i/ii metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs)] were recorded. the results showed that both ap5 and mcpg inhibited the ltd induced by 2-hz multi-train stimulus. the mean amplitude of population spikes (psa) normalized to the baseline was (96.0±3.5)% after applying ap5 (n=10) and (95.7±4.1)% after applying mcpg (n=8), respectively, measured at 20 min post-tetanus. while 5-hz multi-train tetanus failed to induce ltd in the presence of mcpg. the mean psa was (73.6±4.4)% (n=10) and (98.2±8.9)% (n=8) in the presence of ap5 and mcpg, respectively, measured at 35 min post-tetanus. so it is suggested that ltd induced by 2-hz multi-train tetanus involves co-activation of nmdars and mglurs, while ltd induced by 5-hz multi-train tetanus is only related to activation of mglurs.",Chen L,2008,Sheng Li Xue Bao,,18425317,Chen L; Han TZ; Jiang ML,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D015763: 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate; D000818: Animals; D056547: CA1 Region, Hippocampal; D005998: Glycine; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D051381: Rats; D018094: Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",,,https://openalex.org/W2390772155,144,21,1,1308,250,7

false,effect of propranolol on drug-induced and physiological glycogenolysis in the liver.,"the beta-adrenergic blocking agent propranolol had in itself no notable influence on the blood glucose level in rats, but in combination with chlorpropamide it considerably delayed and enhanced the hypoglycaemic and liver glycogenolysis depressing actions of chlorpropamide. this effect was still more pronounced when the rats were treated in addition to propranolol and chlorpropamide with thyroxine or glanduitrine, which in themselves act as stimulators of liver glycogenolysis. the simultaneous administration of propranolol and chlorpropamide depressed considerably the liver glycogenolysis induced by prolonged fasting and inhibited completely the liver glycogenolysis observed after hepatectomy. the reports available in the literature on propranolol-precipitated hypoglycaemia in patients are surveyed and it is supposed that the beta-adrenergic blocking agent produces hypoglycaemia primarily through the depression of liver glycogenolysis. this observation supports the hypothesis that the adrenergic beta-receptors play an important role in the sympathetic control of liver glycogenolysis.",Pogátsa G,1979,Arzneimittelforschung,,583007,Pogátsa G; Dubecz E,article,D016428: Journal Article,D000818: Animals; D001786: Blood Glucose; D002747: Chlorpropamide; D004347: Drug Interactions; D006498: Hepatectomy; D008099: Liver; D008112: Liver Glycogen; D008297: Male; D011433: Propranolol; D051381: Rats; D013974: Thyroxine,,,https://openalex.org/W2461558938,84,12,1,1100,150,5

false,ranitidine inhibits adrenergic but not nonadrenergic noncholinergic transmission in the rat isolated anococcygeus muscle.,"the effects of ranitidine on adrenergic and nonadrenergic noncholinergic transmission in the rat isolated anococcygeus muscle and on the contractile responses of the muscle to noradrenaline, potassium chloride, 5-hydroxytryptamine and carbachol were investigated. ranitidine (2-8 mm) produced a concentration-dependent and readily reversible inhibition of motor (excitatory) responses of the anococcygeus muscle evoked via field stimulation (20-30 v, 10 hz x 10 sec, 1 msec pulse width, every 2 min), whereas the contractile response of the anococcygeus muscle to exogenous noradrenaline (3 microm) was potentiated by 57 +/- 3.7%; the contractile response to potassium chloride (50 mm) was only slightly decreased, whereas the responses to carbachol (3 microm) or 5-hydroxytryptamine (30 microm) were completely inhibited by ranitidine (8 mm). when the tone of the muscle was raised by noradrenaline (3 microm) after complete inhibition of the motor responses by ranitidine (8 mm), field stimulation produced relaxant (inhibitory) responses which were inhibited by tetrodotoxin (2 microm) or ng-nitro-l-arginine methylester (50 microm). similar results were obtained with guanethidine (0.5-3 microm) on adrenergic and non-adrenergic noncholinergic transmission. the results clearly show that ranitidine can selectively inhibit adrenergic transmission in the anococcygeus muscle with consequent unmasking of nonadrenergic noncholinergic transmission; ranitidine can also produce a super-sensitivity-type response of the muscle to exogenous noradrenaline but not to potassium chloride, carbachol or 5-hydroxytryptamine. thus, the inhibition of adrenergic transmission by ranitidine in the rat isolated anococcygeus muscle closely resembles the action of guanethidine on adrenergic transmission.",Gwee MC,1993,Arch Int Pharmacodyn Ther,,8391790,Gwee MC; Cheah LS,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001120: Arginine; D001341: Autonomic Nervous System; D002217: Carbachol; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D003891: Desipramine; D006145: Guanethidine; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008297: Male; D009132: Muscles; D019331: NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; D009638: Norepinephrine; D011189: Potassium Chloride; D011899: Ranitidine; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D012701: Serotonin; D013564: Sympathetic Nervous System; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013779: Tetrodotoxin",,,https://openalex.org/W2463263550,121,15,1,1792,286,6

false,studies on production of biologically active substances which inhibit cell migration in supernatants and extracts of hypersensitive lymphoid cells incubated with specific antigen in vitro.,"when lymphoid cells from hypersensitive rabbits are incubated with antigen, biologically active substances are formed and released which are capable of inhibiting the migration of normal non-sensitized mesenchymal cells. in the present paper some basic parameters of their production were determined. these substances were regularly obtained after 6 and 18 hours incubation, but not after 2 hours. under more favourable cultivation conditions (lower density of lymphocyte suspension) an increased activity in the cell extracts as compared with the supernatants was observed.

another critical factor in the production of these substances is the quantity of antigen added. ten micrograms of ppd leads to the production and liberation of a highly effective substance. a lower dose of antigen results in the liberation of a substance into the supernatant which by itself is almost inactive, but becomes more active when more antigen is added.

the efficiency of the released substances was determined by serial dilution. the inhibiting activity was maintained at 1:5 and 1:20 and sometimes at 1:100 dilutions.",Svejcar J,1968,Immunology,,5664398,Svejcar J; Pekárek J; Johanovský J,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D000941: Antigens; D002465: Cell Movement; D002682: Chinchilla; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D005260: Female; D006967: Hypersensitivity; D008214: Lymphocytes; D008297: Male; D013154: Spleen",,,https://openalex.org/W2404524165,188,26,1,1110,180,9

false,antiarrhythmic effects of ethmozin in cardiac purkinje fibers: suppression of automaticity and abolition of triggering.,"the effects of ethmozin were studied on automatic and triggered impulse initiation in isolated canine cardiac purkinje fibers using standard microelectrode technique. in driven purkinje fibers with normal (greater than or equal to -80 mv) maximum diastolic potentials, ethmozin (2-4 mg/l or 4.3-8.6 mum) slightly increased the slope of phase 4 depolarization. however, the rate of normal automatic firing in such fibers was decreased by ethmozin and the threshold (take-off) potential of the pacemaker cells was shifted in the depolarizing direction (toward zero potential). in fibers treated with barium chloride (0.10-0.50 mm), ""abnormal automaticity"" occurred from maximum diastolic potentials of -38 to -68 mv. ethmozin (2-4 mg/l) consistently slowed and abolished this abnormal automaticity. this appeared to be associated with a decrease in the rate of diastolic depolarization. when lidocaine, 4 or 10 mg/l (17 or 42 mum), was tested on abnormal automaticity induced by barium, it too was found to decrease the rate of diastolic depolarization and decrease the automatic rate. however, lidocaine never terminated barium-induced abnormal automaticity. ethmozin also consistently abolished abnormal automaticity in purkinje fibers taken from the endocardial surface of 24- or 48-h infarct zones. finally, ethmozin (1-4 mg/l or 2.2-8.6 mum) depressed the amplitude of delayed after depolarizations and terminated triggered activity in purkinje fibers taken from 24-hr infarct zones. each of these actions could contribute to the antiarrhythmic effects of ethmozin.",Dangman KH,1983,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,6317840,Dangman KH; Hoffman BF,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D000889: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004285: Dogs; D006329: Heart Conduction System; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008012: Lidocaine; D016293: Moricizine; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D009203: Myocardial Infarction; D010640: Phenothiazines; D011690: Purkinje Fibers; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W1906069748,119,17,1,1568,264,11

false,impact of substance p receptor antagonism on the serotonin and norepinephrine systems: relevance to the antidepressant/anxiolytic response.,"substance p (neurokinin-1 [nk1]) receptor antagonists appear to be effective antidepressant and anxiolytic agents, as indicated in 3 double-blind clinical trials. in laboratory animals, they promptly attenuate the responsiveness of serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-ht]) and norepinephrine (ne) neurons to agonists of their cell-body autoreceptors, as is the case for some antidepressant drugs that are currently in clinical use. long-term, but not subacute, antagonism of nk1 receptors in rats increases 5-ht transmission in the hippocampus, a property common to all antidepressant treatments tested thus far. this enhancement seems to be mediated by a time-dependent increase in the firing rate of 5-ht neurons. mice with the nk1 receptor deleted from their genetic code also have an increased firing rate of 5-ht neurons. taken together, these observations strongly suggest that nk1 antagonists could become a new class of antidepressant and anxiolytic agents.",Blier P,2004,J Psychiatry Neurosci,,15173897,Blier P; Gobbi G; Haddjeri N; Santarelli L; Mathew G; Hen R,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000316: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; D000818: Animals; D000932: Antiemetics; D001007: Anxiety; D000077608: Aprepitant; D017660: Autoreceptors; D003865: Depressive Disorder, Major; D004594: Electrophysiology; D006624: Hippocampus; D008125: Locus Coeruleus; D051379: Mice; D008817: Mice, Mutant Strains; D009025: Morpholines; D064729: Neurokinin-1 Receptor Antagonists; D009638: Norepinephrine; D010656: Phenylephrine; D010784: Photomicrography; D011903: Raphe Nuclei; D018040: Receptors, Neurokinin-1; D012701: Serotonin; D013373: Substance P",,,https://openalex.org/W2162738633,139,19,1,963,161,6

false,biochemical pathology of lung damage produced by chemicals.,"damage to the lung may be caused by chemicals that gain access to the alveolar zone by inhalation or via the pulmonary circulation. several agents toxic to the lung have recently been found to bind covalently to pulmonary macromolecules or to disrupt certain metabolic reactions. however, it has also been observed that extensive chemical lung injury is not necessarily preceded by a depression of pulmonary metabolic reactions. one possible explanation for this might be that biochemical changes due to cell death are often masked and/or compensated for by changes associated with lung tissue repair. substantial cell proliferation as a response to toxic lung damage is a common phenomenon in lung pathology. this makes it necessary to develop models that permit analysis of the biochemical events triggering and accompanying cell growth in lung. we have recently examined some aspects of cell proliferation in mouse lung. intraperitoneal injection of the antioxidant butylated hydroxytoluene (bht) produces within 3-5 days extensive hypertrophy, hyperplasia, and general disorganization of the cellular components of the lung. total lung weight and total dna per lung almost double within this time and are accompanied by proportional increases in protein and lipids. rna accumulates at a faster rate than dna. the changes in lung composition are accompanied by dose-dependent increases in the in vivo incorporation of thymidine into dna and of leucine into protein. the activities of several enzymes (thymidine kinase, dna polymerase, uridine kinase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and 5'-nucleotidase) increase substantially after bht. administration of bht to mice seems to offer a convenient tool to study cell growth in the lungs of mice.",Witschi H,1976,Fed Proc,,1245236,Witschi H; Côté MG,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D002084: Butylated Hydroxytoluene; D002455: Cell Division; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D003408: Cresols; D004254: DNA Nucleotidyltransferases; D004261: DNA Replication; D004048: Diethylamines; D006965: Hyperplasia; D008168: Lung; D051379: Mice; D008854: Microscopy, Electron; D008954: Models, Biological; D009602: Nitrosamines; D010269: Paraquat; D012313: RNA; D013937: Thymidine Kinase; D014541: Uridine Kinase",,,https://openalex.org/W1232004709,59,9,1,1749,287,13
false,circadian phagocytic activity in rats under light-dark and constant light regimens.,"the phagocytic function was proved to be a periodic, circadian process. its acrophase appears to be differently timed in species with different activity type, occurring in the evening in diurnal species and at night in nocturnal ones. the main pineal hormone melatonin, whose secretion occurs strictly at dark, has been shown to play a role in the control of inflammation and to exert a certain stimulatory effect upon phagocytosis in vitro. the aim of the present study was to assess whether the phagocytic activity of neutrophils in the blood of rats exhibits a circadian rhythmicity similar to that of other nocturnal rodents (mice) and also if a constant light regimen alters its amplitude and/or chronostructure. wistar rats were submitted to either an artificial light-dark 12/12 regimen (ld) or to constant light (ll), for 15 days. in vitro phagocytosis of the neutrophils in whole blood against e.coli was assessed at 10:00, 16:00, 22:00, and 04:00 hours. in ld, phagocytosis appears to be a rhythmical function, with statistically significant differences between the highest value at 04:00 hrs and the lowest at 10:00 hrs. constant light induces a 30% depression of the phagocytic ability throughout the whole 24 hours cycle, without altering its oscillations. the darkness period appears to play the role of a synchronizer; in its absence the rhythm tends to free-run. it may be stated that rhythmical melatonin secretion is responsible only for maintenance of the phagocytic level, probably via the anterior hypothalamic area and thymus, while it cannot account directly for the nocturnal increase of phagocytosis.",Hriscu M,2002,Rom J Physiol,,15984664,Hriscu M; Saulea G; Ostriceanu S; Baciu I,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001769: Blood; D002940: Circadian Rhythm; D004926: Escherichia coli; D008027: Light; D008297: Male; D009504: Neutrophils; D010587: Phagocytosis; D017440: Photoperiod; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar",,,https://openalex.org/W2416857126,83,12,1,1625,288,10

false,environmental influences upon drug-induced suppression of operant behavior.,rats were trained to press a lever for food reinforcement and stabilized on a schedule which required 30 lever presses for each pellet. injection of mescaline hydrochloride (10 mg/kg i.p.) just prior to placement into the operant conditioning chamber resulted in a disruption of lever pressing beginning 10 minutes later and lasting about 25 minutes. removal of the rats from the chamber 2 minutes after the onset of drug action and replacement after 2.5 or 5.0 minutes resulted in resumption of bar pressing almost immediately. leaving the animals in their home cages for 10 minutes after the injection (latency to onset of action) also resulted in attenuation of the disruptive effects of the drug. manipulating the dose of mescaline hydrochloride and an examination of d -lysergic acid diethylamide interacting with this phenomenon indicated that the attenuation produced by the manipulation appears to conform to log dose-response relationships and that the behavioral effects of at least one other psychoactive drug can be shortened by the manipulation. the implications of these results are 2-fold: 1) the experimental procedure of injecting a drug and looking for behavioral effects at some predetermined time after administration of the drug should take into account environmental factors as mundane as when the animal is placed into the behavioral chamber. 2) the results described for rats may be analogous to the drug-setting interaction commonly reported for humans reacting to psychoactive agents.,Sparber SB,1971,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,,5096565,Sparber SB; Tilson HA,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D003216: Conditioning, Operant; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004777: Environment; D008238: Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; D008297: Male; D008635: Mescaline; D051381: Rats; D012055: Reinforcement Schedule",,,https://openalex.org/W2291744796,75,9,1,1510,248,8

the depression of contact sensitivity by these three bacterial adjuvants was paralleled by their depression of the arrival of labelled lymph node cells at recently immunized nodes, and supported the hypothesis that failure of recently immunized lymph nodes to collect lymphoid cells is part of the mechanism of depression of delayed hypersensitivity by bacterial adjuvants, and in particular, by c. parvum.",Allwood GG,1972,Clin Exp Immunol,,4343615,Allwood GG; Asherson GL,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000276: Adjuvants, Immunologic; D000818: Animals; D001886: Bordetella pertussis; D002465: Cell Movement; D002859: Chromium Isotopes; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D003877: Dermatitis, Contact; D005620: Freund's Adjuvant; D007114: Immunization; D008099: Liver; D008198: Lymph Nodes; D017710: Lymphocyte Transfusion; D008214: Lymphocytes; D051379: Mice; D008808: Mice, Inbred CBA; D010853: Picryl Chloride; D011425: Propionibacterium acnes; D013154: Spleen; D014184: Transplantation, Homologous",,,https://openalex.org/W1545857330,190,28,3,1493,246,8

false,comprehensive analysis of gene expression profiles regulated by fosb gene in brain,"previous work has implicated the transcription factor, δfosb, acting in the nucleus accumbens, in mediating the pro-rewarding effects of drugs of abuse such as cocaine as well as in mediating resilience to chronic social stress. however, the transgenic and viral gene transfer models used to establish these δfosb phenotypes express, in addition to δfosb, an alternative translation product of δfosb mrna, termed δ2δfosb, which lacks the n-terminal 78 aa present in δfosb. to study the possible contribution of δ2δfosb to these drug and stress phenotypes, we prepared a viral vector that overexpresses a point mutant form of δfosb mrna which cannot undergo alternative translation as well as a vector that overexpresses δ2δfosb alone. our results show that the mutant form of δfosb, when overexpressed in the nucleus accumbens, reproduces the enhancement of reward and of resilience seen with our earlier models, with no effects seen for δ2δfosb. overexpression of full length fosb, the other major product of the fosb gene, also has no effect. these findings confirm the unique role of δfosb in the nucleus accumbens in controlling responses to drugs of abuse and stress.",,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2011.07.516,,,,,,,,https://openalex.org/W1988629862,82,12,1,1172,206,6

true,adaptation of monoaminergic responses to phencyclidine in nucleus accumbens and prefrontal cortex following repeated treatment with fluoxetine or imipramine,"the adaptive neuronal changes that follow chronic administration of antidepressant drugs are thought to underlie clinical improvement in patient populations. recent evidence suggests that alterations specific to n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors may be a final common pathway to antidepressant action. to investigate this possibility, we sought to establish the effects of chronic fluoxetine or imipramine treatment on the monoamine stimulating effect of the non-competitive nmda antagonist phencyclidine. male, sprague-dawley rats (n=9/group) were treated with saline (1 ml/kg, i.p.), imipramine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) or fluoxetine (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once daily for 14 consecutive days. after a 7-day drug-free period, animals given an acute challenge of either saline or phencyclidine (5 mg/kg, i.p.). one hour later, animals were killed, brains were removed, and the prefrontal cortex, striatum, and nucleus accumbens were dissected. samples were assayed for the monoamines and their primary metabolites by hplc. repeated treatment with fluoxetine or imipramine did not alter baseline dopamine or serotonin turnover. acute phencyclidine treatment increased prefrontal cortex and nucleus accumbens dopamine turnover in saline-treated animals (p<0.01); however, the effect in the nucleus accumbens was prevented in animals pretreated with imipramine or fluoxetine. acute phencyclidine challenge also increased serotonin turnover in prefrontal cortex of saline- or imipramine-pretreated rats (p<0.01), though this effect was attenuated in animals pretreated with fluoxetine. overall, the data suggest that repeated antidepressant treatment alters monoamine turnover in specific brain regions in response to blockade of nmda receptors. the data highlight the importance of adaptive responses to nmda receptors resulting from chronic antidepressant treatment.",De La Garza R,2002,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-8993(02)03772-1,12468026,De La Garza R; Jentsch JD; Verrico CD; Roth RH,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000222: Adaptation, Physiological; D018759: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D015306: Biogenic Monoamines; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004298: Dopamine; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D005473: Fluoxetine; D007099: Imipramine; D008297: Male; D017072: Neostriatum; D009714: Nucleus Accumbens; D010622: Phencyclidine; D017397: Prefrontal Cortex; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D012701: Serotonin; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",,,https://openalex.org/W2034556970,156,19,1,1854,302,15

true,norepinephrine transporter knock-out alters expression of the genes connected with antidepressant drugs action,"norepinephrine transporter knock-out mice (net-ko) exhibit depression-resistant phenotypes. they manifest significantly shorter immobility times in both the forced swim test and the tail suspension test. moreover, biochemical studies have revealed the up-regulation of other monoamine transporters (dopamine and serotonin) in the brains of net-ko mice, similar to the phenomenon observed after the chronic pharmacological blockade of norepinephrine transporter by desipramine in wild-type (wt) animals. net-ko mice are also resistant to stress, as we demonstrated previously by measuring plasma corticosterone concentration. in the present study, we used a microdissection technique to separate target brain regions and the taqman low density array approach to test the expression of a group of genes in the net-ko mice compared with wt animals. a group of genes with altered expression were identified in four brain structures (frontal and cingulate cortices, dentate gyrus of hippocampus and basal-lateral amygdala) of net-ko mice compared with wt mice. these genes are known to be altered by antidepressant drugs administration. the most interesting gene is crh-bp, which modulates the activity of corticotrophin--releasing hormone (crh) and several crh-family members. generally, genetic disturbances within noradrenergic neurons result in biological changes, such as in signal transduction and intercellular communication, and may be linked to changes in noradrenaline levels in the brains of net-ko mice.",Solich J,2015,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2014.10.055,25451113,Solich J; Kolasa M; Kusmider M; Faron-Gorecka A; Pabian P; Zurawek D; Szafran-Pilch K; Dziedzicka-Wasylewska M,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001921: Brain; D002352: Carrier Proteins; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D018345: Mice, Knockout; D042282: Microdissection; D009414: Nerve Growth Factors; D009479: Neuropeptides; D050484: Norepinephrine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; D020133: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; D059467: Transcriptome",,,https://openalex.org/W2088034141,110,13,1,1510,241,9
false,strain variations in the utilization of hexoses by ehrlich ascites tumor cells,"1. the utilization of glucose, fructose, mannose, galactose and glucosamine by six different strains of the ehrlich ascites carcinoma was investigated. 2. considerable amounts of fructose were utilized by five of the strains. the sixth (strain w), however, converted fructose to lactic acid only to a very limited extent. in the latter strain chromatographic and enzymic methods revealed no metabolites of fructose, although the enzymes necessary for fructolysis could be detected. it is suggested that this was caused by restricted entry of fructose into these cells. 3. glucosamine is capable of penetrating the cells of all six strains. it results, as does glucose, in a depression of the cellullar oxygen consumption (crabtree effect), although there is no evidence of a glycolytic degradation of this amino sugar. however, as demonstrated with strain w, phosphorylation of glucosamine and formation of intermediates of mucopolysaccharide and glycoprotein synthesis takes place. it is very likely that the inability to utilize glucosamine via the embden-meyerhof pathway is caused by too low an activity of glucosamine-6-phosphate deaminase. nevertheless, depression of cellular respiration is observed, which indicates the primary importance of the phosphorylation step in the occurrence of this effect. 4. it is shown that different strains of the ehrlich ascites tumor may differ appreciably one from another in biochemical properties; this could explain conflicting results reported in the literature. it is also seen that comparative investigations of suitable strains may serve as a useful tool in solving problems of cellular metabolism.",Letnansky K,1968,Biochim Biophys Acta,https://doi.org/10.1016/0304-4165(68)90214-6,5737930,Letnansky K,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000818: Animals; D001202: Ascitic Fluid; D001692: Biological Transport; D002286: Carcinoma, Ehrlich Tumor; D002460: Cell Line; D002463: Cell Membrane Permeability; D002852: Chromatography, Ion Exchange; D002875: Chromosomes; D046508: Culture Techniques; D003582: Cytogenetics; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D005632: Fructose; D005690: Galactose; D005944: Glucosamine; D005947: Glucose; D006601: Hexoses; D007535: Isomerases; D007770: L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; D007773: Lactates; D008358: Mannose; D008722: Methods; D051379: Mice; D010101: Oxygen Consumption; D010770: Phosphotransferases; D011123: Polyploidy",,,https://openalex.org/W2045999921,78,12,1,1648,278,16

false,activation of group i metabotropic glutamate receptors induces long-term depression in the hippocampal ca1 region of adult rats in vitro,"previous studies have implicated that long-term depression (ltd) was developmentally regulated since ltd can be readily induced by low frequency stimulation (lfs) in acute hippocampal slices prepared from juvenile but not adult animals. here, we have examined the ltd induced by lfs (1 hz, 900 pulses) paired with a certain pattern at the schaffer collateral-cal synapse in adult hippocampal slices. we found that, in the 90-day-old rat hippocampus, ltd could be induced reliably by lfs paired with stronger stimulus intensity than that used during baseline recording. however, this synaptic depression could be completely abolished by application of metabotropic glutamate receptor (mglur) antagonist (s)-amethyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (mcpg) which had no effect on that induced by the same protocol in the 16-day-old rat hippocampus. furthermore, preincubation with group i mglur antagonist, 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine (mpep) and (s)-2-methyl-4-carboxyphenylglycine (ly367385), also completely prevented the lfs-induced ltd. in contrast, group ii mglur antagonist (2s)-a-ethylglutamic acid (eglu), n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonist apv and voltage-gated calcium channel antagonist nimodipine had no effect on the lfs-induced ltd. taken together, these observations suggest that lfs paired with strong stimulus strength can efficiently induce group i mglur-dependent ltd in the adult hippocampal ca1 region, proving insight into the functional significance of hippocampal mglur-mediated ltd in learning and memory.",Wang W,2008,Neurosci Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neures.2008.06.002,18602428,Wang W; Zhang Z; Shang J; Jiang ZZ; Wang S; Liu Y; Zhang LY,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000367: Age Factors; D000375: Aging; D000818: Animals; D001369: Axons; D001565: Benzoates; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D005998: Glycine; D006624: Hippocampus; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009434: Neural Pathways; D009474: Neurons; D009924: Organ Culture Techniques; D011725: Pyridines; D051381: Rats; D064529: Receptor, Metabotropic Glutamate 5; D018094: Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate; D013570: Synaptic Membranes; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W1995470858,136,20,1,1538,253,6
false,losartan increases renal blood flow during isoflurane anesthesia in sheep,"background: inhaled anesthetics cause a transient reversible depression of renal function by direct renal effects or indirectly by changes in neurohumoral systems or cardiovascular performance. when the sympathetic nervous activity is decreased during anesthesia, other vasoactive systems like vasopressin (avp) and particularly the renin angiotensin system (ras) are of importance for blood pressure maintenance. little is known about how the renal circulation is affected by angiotensin receptor blockade during isoflurane anesthesia. methods: the study was performed on isoflurane anesthetized sheep equipped with flow probes (placed around a femoral and a renal artery) and a pulmonary artery catheter. during stable conditions the sheep were given one or more of the following substances: isotonic saline (nacl); losartan (los) 10 mg · kg −1 ; prazosin (praz) 0.2 mg · kg −1 and a vasopressin v 1 ‐receptor antagonist (avp‐a) 10 μg · kg −1 . results: los and avp‐a did not affect mean arterial pressure (map), whereas praz lowered map significantly (from 98±12 to 65±7 mmhg). renal blood flow (rbf) increased after los treatment (148±34 to 222±33 ml · min −1 ). the other substances were without effect on rbf. femoral blood flow remained unchanged after all treatments. conclusion: we conclude that the sympathoadrenal system is still the major determinant for blood pressure maintenance during isoflurane anesthesia in sheep. the apparently increased activity of the renin angiotensin system in this situation causes a reduction in renal blood flow, which is counteracted by angiotensin ii at 1 ‐receptor blockade.",Ullman J,2001,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://doi.org/10.1034/j.1399-6576.2001.450919.x,11683670,Ullman J; Eriksson S; Rundgren M,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000758: Anesthesia; D018685: Anesthetics, Inhalation; D000818: Animals; D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D005260: Female; D006439: Hemodynamics; D006614: Hindlimb; D007530: Isoflurane; D019808: Losartan; D009994: Osmolar Concentration; D011224: Prazosin; D012039: Regional Blood Flow; D012079: Renal Circulation; D012756: Sheep; D014667: Vasopressins",,,https://openalex.org/W2082785573,73,10,1,1621,286,11
false,subarachnoid hemorrhage induces dynamic changes in regional cerebral metabolism in rats,"following a subarachnoid hemorrhage (sah), adult rats exhibit dynamic regional changes in cerebral glucose metabolism characterized by an increase in metabolic rates and a subsequent upregulation of cytochrome oxidase (co). we evaluated both local cerebral metabolic rates for glucose (icmrglc: (mol/100 g/min) and co in 23 brain regions of interest (roi). sham animals underwent anesthesia and superficial surgery; saline-controls received an injection of 0.9% saline into the cisterna magna; and sah rats received an injection of autologous blood into the cisterna magna. this blood, measured by albumin labeled with radioactive carbon 14, distributed throughout the brain but predominated ventrally. after experimental animals were sacrificed at day 0 (3 h), 1, 3, and 7 days postinjection, roi were analyzed using [14c]2-deoxy-d-glucose autoradiography and co histochemistry. icmrglc in sah rats increased in many regions (ranging from 0.7% to 32.2% above sham levels). cytochrome oxidase also increased from 1% to 9% above sham levels, peaking on day 3. conversely, saline-controls exhibited prolonged depression of icmrglc (ranging from 11% to 35% below sham levels) and co (ranging from 4% to 11% below sham levels) from day 0 through day 7. all saline-control roi for all time points showed this metabolic depression, and between 91% and 95% of saline-control roi presented lower co levels as compared to sham. overall, icmrglc and co levels were greater in sah than in saline-control roi. however, when considering the influence of subarachnoid blood on metabolic changes in sah animals, both co and 2dg levels did not correlate well with the amount of 14c-albumin binding. while previous studies have measured both metabolic rates of glucose and co soon after sah, this is the first to simultaneously conduct these measurements in the same sah rat model.",Glenn TC,2002,J Neurotrauma,https://doi.org/10.1089/08977150252932406,11990351,Glenn TC; Patel AB; Martin NA; Samii A; De Jesus C; Hovda DA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",D000818: Animals; D001345: Autoradiography; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D003576: Electron Transport Complex IV; D005947: Glucose; D006624: Hippocampus; D007150: Immunohistochemistry; D008297: Male; D051381: Rats; D013345: Subarachnoid Hemorrhage; D013788: Thalamus,,,https://openalex.org/W2088336015,87,11,1,1864,345,12
false,m4 muscarinic receptor signaling ameliorates striatal plasticity deficits in models of l-dopa-induced dyskinesia.,"a balanced interaction between dopaminergic and cholinergic signaling in the striatum is critical to goal-directed behavior. but how this interaction modulates corticostriatal synaptic plasticity underlying learned actions remains unclear--particularly in direct-pathway spiny projection neurons (dspns). our studies show that in dspns, endogenous cholinergic signaling through m4 muscarinic receptors (m4rs) promoted long-term depression of corticostriatal glutamatergic synapses, by suppressing regulator of g protein signaling type 4 (rgs4) activity, and blocked d1 dopamine receptor dependent long-term potentiation (ltp). furthermore, in a mouse model of l-3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-dopa)-induced dyskinesia (lid) in parkinson's disease (pd), boosting m4r signaling with positive allosteric modulator (pam) blocked aberrant ltp in dspns, enabled ltp reversal, and attenuated dyskinetic behaviors. an m4r pam also was effective in a primate lid model. taken together, these studies identify an important signaling pathway controlling striatal synaptic plasticity and point to a novel pharmacological strategy for alleviating lid in pd patients.",Shen W,2015,Neuron,10.1016/j.neuron.2015.10.039,26590347,Shen W; Plotkin JL; Francardo V; Ko WK; Xie Z; Li Q; Fieblinger T; Wess J; Neubig RR; Lindsley CW; Conn PJ; Greengard P; Bezard E; Cenci MA; Surmeier DJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000494: Allosteric Regulation; D000818: Animals; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D015259: Dopamine Agents; D004409: Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D007980: Levodopa; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008253: Macaca mulatta; D051379: Mice; D008822: Mice, Transgenic; D017072: Neostriatum; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009474: Neurons; D020734: Parkinsonian Disorders; D020710: RGS Proteins; D043588: Receptor, Muscarinic M4; D015398: Signal Transduction",,,,113,14,1,1152,181,6
false,frequency facilitation at mossy fiber-ca3 synapses of freely behaving rats contributes to the induction of persistent ltd via an adenosine-a1 receptor-regulated mechanism,"frequency facilitation (ff), comprising a rapid and multiple-fold increase in the magnitude of evoked field potentials, is elicited by low-frequency stimulation (lfs) at mossy fiber-ca3 synapses. here, we show that in freely behaving rats, ff reliably occurs in response to 1 and 2hz but not in response to 0.25-, 0.3-, or 0.5-hz lfs. strikingly, prolonged (approximately 600 s) ff was tightly correlated to the induction of long-term depression (ltd) in freely moving animals. although lfs at 2 hz elicited unstable ff and unstable ltd, application of lfs at 1 hz elicited pronounced ff, as well as robust ltd that persisted for over 24 h. this correlation of prolonged ff with ltd was absent at stimulation frequencies that did not induce ff. the adenosine-a1 receptor appears to participate in these effects: application of adenosine-a1, but not adenosine-a3, receptor antagonists enhanced mossy fiber synaptic transmission and occluded ff. furthermore, adenosine-a1 receptor antagonism resulted in more stable ff at 1 or 2 hz and elicited more potent ltd. these data support the fact that ff contributes to the enablement of long-term information storage at mossy fiber-ca3 synapses and that the adenosine-a1 receptor may regulate the thresholds for this process.",Hagena H,2010,Cereb Cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhp184,19903765,Hagena H; Manahan-Vaughan D,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D058916: Adenosine A1 Receptor Antagonists; D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D001703: Biophysics; D056654: CA3 Region, Hippocampal; D003521: Cyclopropanes; D004095: Dihydropyridines; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D005998: Glycine; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008297: Male; D019599: Mossy Fibers, Hippocampal; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D043682: Receptor, Adenosine A1; D013223: Statistics as Topic; D013997: Time Factors; D014633: Valine; D014851: Wakefulness; D014970: Xanthines; D014992: Xylenes",,,https://openalex.org/W2170006311,170,22,1,1267,224,7
false,the onset of response habituation during the growth of the lateral giant neuron of crayfish,"1. the postembryonic development of the crayfish lg tailflip command neuron's response to mechanosensory input was studied with standard electrophysiological techniques in animals between 1 and 12 cm long. 2. lg neurons are present in each abdominal hemisegment where they receive direct and indirect excitatory input from mechanosensory afferents. in both small and large crayfish, electrical stimulation of an abdominal ganglionic nerve containing those afferents evoked a compound excitatory postsynaptic potential (epsp) with an early, reliable alpha component and a later, depression-prone beta wave. it is known that the alpha and beta components are produced by inputs from primary mechanosensory afferents and interneurons, respectively. 3. in crayfish < 2 cm long, lg was excited by the alpha component. when superthreshold, the alpha component triggered a single spike; additional excitation provided by the later beta wave presumably was preempted by refractoriness following the alpha spike and by recurrent inhibition of lg excited by the spike. lg was excited reliably by the alpha component in response to repeated superthreshold stimulation. 4. in crayfish between 2 and 3 cm, lg was excited more readily by the beta wave than by the alpha component. lg's beta spike response habituated to repeated stimulation at 1 hz, and the beta epsp depressed whereas the alpha component was largely unchanged. the appearance of the cellular substrates of habituation correlates with the reported onset of behavioral habituation of the tailflip response. higher stimulus levels brought the alpha epsp to threshold. repetitive stimulation at these levels reliably evoked lg spikes from the alpha epsp.(abstract truncated at 250 words)",Edwards DH,1994,J Neurophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.1994.72.2.890,7983544,Edwards DH; Fricke RA; Barnett LD; Yeh SR; Leise EM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000344: Afferent Pathways; D000818: Animals; D001143: Arousal; D003400: Astacoidea; D001369: Axons; D002799: Cholinergic Fibers; D003712: Dendrites; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D017952: Ganglia, Invertebrate; D006185: Habituation, Psychophysiologic; D007395: Interneurons; D008465: Mechanoreceptors; D009415: Nerve Net; D011930: Reaction Time; D012684: Sensory Thresholds; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013623: Tail",,,https://openalex.org/W2437269401,91,15,1,1740,293,17
false,effects of isoproterenol on myocardial structure and function in septic rats,"in this study we sought to determine the effect of sepsis on two sequelae of prolonged (24-h) β-agonist administration, myocardial hypertrophy and catecholamine-induced cardiotoxicity. sprague-dawley rats were randomized to cecal ligation and perforation (clp) or sham study groups and then further randomized to receive isoproterenol (2.4 mg ⋅ kg −1 ⋅ day −1 iv) or placebo treatment. at 24 h, myocardial function was assessed by using the langendorff isolated-heart technique or the heart processed for plain light microscopy. we found that 1) sepsis reduced contractile function, indicated by a rightward shift in the starling curve (anova with repeated measures, sepsis effect, p < 0.002); 2) sepsis-induced myocardial depression was reversed by isoproterenol treatment (isoproterenol effect, p < 0.0001); 3) sepsis reduced, but did not block, isoproterenol-induced myocardial hypertrophy (isoproterenol effect, p < 0.0001); 4) sepsis did not protect the heart from catecholamine-induced tissue injury; 5) the septic heart was protected against the effects of ischemiareperfusion (decreased postreperfusion resting tension, anova with repeated measures, p < 0.01), an effect attenuated by isoproterenol treatment ( p < 0.005); and 6) sepsis reduced the incidence of sustained asystole or ventricular fibrillation after ischemia-reperfusion ( p < 0.05), an effect also attenuated by isoproterenol treatment ( p < 0.01). we conclude that, in sepsis, β-agonists induce changes in myocardial weight and function consistent with acute myocardial hypertrophy. these changes occur at the expense of significant tissue injury and increased sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion-induced tissue injury.",Piper RD,1999,J Appl Physiol (1985),https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1999.86.3.993,10066715,Piper RD; Li FY; Myers ML; Sibbald WJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000318: Adrenergic beta-Agonists; D000818: Animals; D001772: Blood Cell Count; D001794: Blood Pressure; D003326: Coronary Circulation; D006321: Heart; D006439: Hemodynamics; D007545: Isoproterenol; D015428: Myocardial Reperfusion Injury; D009206: Myocardium; D009929: Organ Size; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D018805: Sepsis",,,https://openalex.org/W2298419517,76,11,1,1715,303,6
false,glucocorticoid programing of the mesopontine cholinergic system,"stress perception, response, adaptation and coping strategies are individually distinct, and the sequel of stress and/or glucocorticoids is also distinct between subjects. in the last years, it has become clear that early life stress is a powerful modulator of neuroendocrine stress-responsive circuits, programming intrinsic susceptibility to stress, and potentiating the appearance of stress-related disorders such as depression, anxiety and addiction. herein we were interested in understanding how early life experiences reset the normal processing of negative stimuli, leading to emotional dysfunction. animals prenatally exposed to glucocorticoids (iugc) present hyperanxiety, increased fear behaviour and hyper-reactivity to negative stimuli. in parallel, we found a remarkable increase in the number of aversive 22khz ultrasonic vocalizations in response to an aversive cue. considering the suggested role of the mesopontine tegmentum cholinergic pathway, arising from the laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (ldt) and pedunculopontine tegmental nucleus (ppt), in the initiation of 22khz vocalizations and hypothetically in the control of emotional arousal and tone, we decided to evaluate the condition of this circuit in iugc animals. notably, in a basal situation, iugc animals present increased choline acetyltransferase (chat) expression in the ldt and ppt, but not in other cholinergic nuclei, namely in the nucleus basalis of meynert. in addition, and in accordance with the amplified response to an adverse stimulus of iugc animals, we found marked changes in the cholinergic activation pattern of ldt and ppt regions. altogether, our results suggest a specific cholinergic pathway programing by prenatal gc, and hint that this may be of relevance in setting individuals stress vulnerability threshold.",Borges S,2013,Front Endocrinol (Lausanne),https://doi.org/10.3389/fendo.2013.00190,24379803,Borges S; Coimbra B; Soares-Cunha C; Ventura-Silva AP; Pinto L; Carvalho MM; Pêgo JM; Rodrigues AJ; Sousa N,article,D016428: Journal Article,,,,https://openalex.org/W2102713298,63,7,1,1813,293,9

false,the hemodynamic effects of γ2-melanocyte-stimulating hormone and related melanotropins depend on the arousal potential of the rat,"in conscious rats, i.v. administered adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth))-(4–10)) and γ2-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (γ2-msh) induced a dose-dependent increase in blood pressure (bp), heart rate (hr) and pulse pressure (pp). no circadian influence on these effects was observed. the structurally related peptide, α-melanocyte-stimulating hormone (α-msh), only caused an increase in hr, which was not dose-dependent, whereas the stable acth-(4–9) analog, org 2766, was without effect on these hemodynamic parameters. in rats under light urethane-induced anesthesia, which is known to maintain reflexes and sufficient synpathetic tone, γ2-msh caused hemodynamic responses similar to those observed in conscious rats. in contrast, γ2-msh had an opposite effect in rats under deep pentobarbital-induced anesthesia: a depressor effect combined with a slight bradycardia. a comparative study with rats of a more arousable wistar rat substrain (riv: tox) and of a less excitable rat substrain (u:wu) showed that the dose-pressor response curves for acth-(4–10) and γ2-msh were shifted to the left in the more excitable rats as compared to the in the less excitable rats. we conclude that a restricted amino acid sequence in the n-terminal part of the pro-opiomelanocortin (pomc)-molecule (γ2-msh/acth-(4–10)-like) is responsible for the stimulating effects on the cardiovascular system and that those effects are strongly dependent on the state of arousal, i.e. sympathetic tone, of the rat. these stimulatory effects override a depressor phenomenon which can only be detected during central depression.",De Wildt DJ,1993,Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(93)90362-l,8386086,De Wildt DJ; Krugers H; Kasbergen CM; De Lang H; Versteeg DH,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000324: Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; D000595: Amino Acid Sequence; D000818: Animals; D000927: Anticonvulsants; D001143: Arousal; D001784: Blood Gas Analysis; D001794: Blood Pressure; D006339: Heart Rate; D006439: Hemodynamics; D008297: Male; D009074: Melanocyte-Stimulating Hormones; D008969: Molecular Sequence Data; D010446: Peptide Fragments; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013045: Species Specificity; D000521: alpha-MSH",,,https://openalex.org/W2053623929,129,17,1,1598,289,10
false,"seasonality of dihydropyridine receptor binding in the heart of an anoxia-tolerant vertebrate, the crucian carp (carassius carassiusl.)","prolonged anoxia tolerance of facultative anaerobes is based on metabolic depression and thus on controlled reduction of energy-utilizing processes. one proposed survival mechanism is the closing of ion channels to decrease energetic cost of ion pumping (hochachka pw. science 231: 234–241, 1986). to test this hypothesis, the involvement of l-type ca 2+ channels in seasonal anoxia tolerance of the vertebrate heart was examined by determining the number of [ methyl- 3 h]pn200–110 (a ligand of l-type ca 2+ channel α-subunit) binding sites of the cardiac tissue and the density of ca 2+ current in ventricular myocytes of an anoxia-resistant fish species, the crucian carp. in their natural environment, the fish were exposed for >3 mo of hypoxia (o 2 <2.5 mg/l) followed by almost 8 wk of anoxia that resulted in abrupt depletion of cardiac glycogen stores in late spring. unexpectedly, however, the number of [ methyl- 3 h]pn200–110 binding sites did not decline in hypoxia/anoxia as predicted by the channel arrest hypothesis but remained constant for most of the year. however, in early summer, the number of [ methyl- 3 h]pn200–110 binding sites doubled for a period of ∼2 mo, which functionally appeared as a 74% larger ca 2+ current density. thus the anoxia tolerance of the carp heart cannot be based on downregulation of ca 2+ channel units in myocytes but is likely to depend on suppressed heart rate, i.e., regulation of the heart at the systemic level, and direct depressive effects of low temperature on ca 2+ current to achieve savings in cardiac work load and ion pumping. the summer peak in the number of functional ca 2+ channels indicates a short period of high cardiac activity possibly associated with reproduction and active perfusion of tissues after the winter stresses.",Vornanen M,2004,Am J Physiol Regul Integr Comp Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.00317.2004,15242827,Vornanen M; Paajanen V,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001831: Body Temperature; D020746: Calcium Channels, L-Type; D002347: Carps; D003463: Cues; D006321: Heart; D000860: Hypoxia; D017275: Isradipine; D007700: Kinetics; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D009206: Myocardium; D032383: Myocytes, Cardiac; D010101: Oxygen Consumption; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D017440: Photoperiod; D012508: Sarcolemma; D012621: Seasons",,,https://openalex.org/W2078829960,142,28,1,1801,335,9

false,bone conducted vibration activates the vestibulo-ocular reflex in the guinea pig,"the aim of the study was: (a) to test whether short duration (6 ms) 500 hz bone-conducted vibration (bcv) of the skull in alert head free guinea pigs would elicit eye movements; (b) to test whether these eye movements were vestibular in origin; and (c) to determine whether they corresponded to human eye movements to such stimuli. in this way we sought to establish the guinea pig as an acceptable model for testing the mechanism of the effect bcv on the vestibulo-ocular reflex. consistent short-latency stimulus-locked responses to bcv were observed. the magnitude of eye displacement was directly related to stimulus intensity as recorded by accelerometers cemented onto the animal's skull. the strongest and most consistent response component was intorsion of both eyes. in lateral-eyed animals intorsion is produced by the combined contraction of the inferior rectus and superior oblique muscles. in humans the same pair of muscles acts to cause depression of the eye. to test whether the movements were vestibular we selectively ablated the vestibular endorgans: 3 of the 8 animals underwent a bilateral intratympanic injection of gentamicin, an ototoxic aminoglycoside antibiotic, to ablate their vestibular receptors. after ablation there was an overall reduction in the magnitude of eye displacement, as well as a reduction in the effectiveness of the bcv stimulus to elicit eye movements. the animals’ hearing, as measured by the threshold for auditory brainstem responses, remained unchanged after gentamicin, confirming that the cochlea was not affected. the reduced magnitude of responses after vestibular receptor ablation demonstrates that the eye-movement responses to bcv are probably caused by the stimulation of vestibular receptors, which in turn activate the vestibulo-ocular reflex.",Vulovic V,2011,Brain Res Bull,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2011.06.013,21745548,Vulovic V; Curthoys IS,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000900: Anti-Bacterial Agents; D001844: Bone Conduction; D003051: Cochlea; D016057: Evoked Potentials, Auditory, Brain Stem; D005133: Eye Movements; D005839: Gentamicins; D006168: Guinea Pigs; D006801: Humans; D012027: Reflex, Vestibulo-Ocular; D012886: Skull; D014722: Vestibule, Labyrinth; D014732: Vibration",,,https://openalex.org/W2028939054,80,11,1,1805,307,11
false,depression of nociceptive sensory activity in the rat spinal cord due to the intrathecal administration of drugs: effect of diazepam,"abstract the intrathecal (i.t.) administration of morphine inhibits nociceptive motor responses and activity in ascending axons evoked by stimulation of nociceptive afferent nerve fibers (nociceptive sensory response) in the rat. the i.t. administration of cholecystokinin octapeptide and ceruletide inhibits nociceptive motor responses, but does not affect ascending nociceptive activity. this shows that drug-induced depression of nociceptive motor responses is not always associated with depression of the nociceptive sensory response of the spinal cord. the microiontophoretic application of substance p excites single dorsal horn neurons that respond to noxious stimulation, whereas the i.t. administration of substance p inhibits both nociceptive motor and sensory responses. thus, the results obtained from the i.t. administration of a drug may differ from those obtained from its application to single spinal neurons. diazepam inhibits spinal reflexes and may reduce pain sensation in humans. to assess whether a spinal action is involved in the pain-relieving effect of diazepam, experiments were carried out on spinalized rats in which activity evoked by the stimulation of nociceptive and nonnociceptive afferent nerve fibers of the sural nerve was recorded from single ascending axons below the site of spinal cord transection. diazepam, 20 ųg i.t., reduced activity evoked by afferent a delta and c fiber stimulation and by stimulation of afferent a beta fibers. the depressant effect caused by diazepam, 2 mg/kg i.v., on c fiber-evoked ascending activity was reduced by the i.t. injection of the benzodiazepine antagonist, ro 15-1788 (40 ųg), an imidazodiazepine. it is concluded that the depression by diazepam of c fiber-evoked ascending activity contributes to pain relief caused by the drug.",Jurna I,1984,Neurosurgery,https://doi.org/10.1097/00006123-198412000-00029,6096760,Jurna I,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000344: Afferent Pathways; D000818: Animals; D003975: Diazepam; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D005260: Female; D005727: Ganglia, Spinal; D007278: Injections, Spinal; D008297: Male; D009020: Morphine; D009046: Motor Neurons; D009412: Nerve Fibers; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009619: Nociceptors; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains; D012677: Sensation; D013116: Spinal Cord; D013497: Sural Nerve; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2047300440,132,21,1,1809,294,15

false,"comparison of cardiac actions of doxorubicin, pirarubicin and aclarubicin in isolated guinea-pig heart","the cardiac actions of doxorubicin were compared with those of pirarubicin and aclarubicin to understand the mechanisms responsible for differences in cardiotoxic effects of anthracycline agents. in left atrial muscle preparations obtained from guinea-pig heart and stimulated at 2 hz, anthracyclines produced positive inotropic effects. the magnitude of the effect was pirarubicin > doxorubicin > aclarubicin. the order for depression of potentiated postrest contraction and prolongation of the time to peak twitch tension was doxorubicin > pirarubicin > acalrubicin. drug washout following a 2-h incubation with 100 μm doxorubicin prevented a further increase in the time to peak twitch tension, caused a marked recovery of depressed potentiated postrest contractions, and augmented the positive inotropic effect. pirarubicin and doxorubicin, but not aclarubicin, caused a parallel rightward shift of the dose-response curve for the negative inotropic effect of acetylcholine. the potency of inhibition of [3h]quinuclidinyl benzilate binding was pirarubicin > doxorubicin > aclarubicin. these results indicate that three anthracycline anticancer agents share similar effects on cardiac muscle contractility and on muscarinic acetylcholine receptors. the actions of aclarubicin were weak compared to those of doxorubicin or pirarubicin. increases in the time to peak twitch tension and the depression of potentiated postrest contraction are apparently mediated by mechanisms different from those responsible for the positive inotropic effects or antagonism at muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.",Temma K,1993,Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0014-2999(93)90951-d,8482324,Temma K; Akera T; Chugun A; Kondo H; Hagane K; Hirano S,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D015250: Aclarubicin; D000818: Animals; D000903: Antibiotics, Antineoplastic; D002118: Calcium; D004317: Doxorubicin; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005260: Female; D006168: Guinea Pigs; D006321: Heart; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008297: Male; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D010276: Parasympatholytics; D011813: Quinuclidinyl Benzilate",,,https://openalex.org/W2085853985,102,14,1,1596,237,10
false,ampa receptor signaling through brag2 and arf6 critical for long-term synaptic depression,"central nervous system synapses undergo activity-dependent alterations to support learning and memory. long-term depression (ltd) reflects a sustained reduction of the synaptic ampa receptor content based on targeted clathrin-mediated endocytosis. here we report a current-independent form of ampa receptor signaling, fundamental for ltd. we found that ampa receptors directly interact via the glua2 subunit with the synaptic protein brag2, which functions as a guanine-nucleotide exchange factor (gef) for the coat-recruitment gtpase arf6. brag2-mediated catalysis, controlled by ligand-binding and tyrosine phosphorylation of glua2, activates arf6 to internalize synaptic ampa receptors upon ltd induction. furthermore, acute blockade of the glua2-brag2 interaction and targeted deletion of brag2 in mature hippocampal ca1 pyramidal neurons prevents ltd in ca3-to-ca1 cell synapses, irrespective of the induction pathway. we conclude that brag2-mediated arf6 activation triggered by ampa receptors is the convergent step of different forms of ltd, thus providing an essential mechanism for the control of vesicle formation by endocytic cargo.",Scholz R,2010,Neuron,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2010.05.003,20547133,Scholz R; Berberich S; Rathgeber L; Kolleker A; Köhr G; Kornau HC,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article,"D000089982: ADP-Ribosylation Factor 6; D020727: ADP-Ribosylation Factors; D000818: Animals; D002460: Cell Line; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D022162: Cytoplasmic Vesicles; D004705: Endocytosis; D020662: Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factors; D006801: Humans; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D051379: Mice; D009419: Nerve Tissue Proteins; D009474: Neurons; D051381: Rats; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D015398: Signal Transduction",,,https://openalex.org/W2046496537,89,12,1,1144,171,6

true,chronic corticosterone injections induce a decrease of atp levels and sustained activation of amp-activated protein kinase in hippocampal tissues of male mice,"chronic corticosterone injections induce hippocampus tissue damage and depression-like behavior in rodent animals, the cause of which is not known. nevertheless, increasing evidence shows that adenylate kinase (ak) and amp-activated protein kinase (ampk) play a very important role in intracellular energy metabolism and are especially critical for neurons which are known to have very small energy reserves and narrow margin of safety between the energy that can be generated and the energy required for maximum activity. abnormalities of ak or ampk system have detrimental effects on neurons or brain function especially at times of increased activity. in this study, we investigated the effects of chronic corticosterone exposure on energy metabolism, as well as ak and ampk in hippocampal tissues in male c57bl/6n mice. our results show that chronic corticosterone injection induced depression-like behavior in male mice, significantly decreased the energy levels and caused a sustained increase of amp:atp ratio in hippocampal tissues. interestingly, chronic corticosterone injections did not produce obvious effects on ak1 protein and mrna levels, but caused a sustained activation of ampk. the results indicate that sustained ampk activation might be a mechanism by which chronic corticosterone treatment causes depression-like behavior in male mice.",Zhao Y,2008,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2007.11.027,18164281,Zhao Y; Shen J; Su H; Li B; Xing D; Du L,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D055372: AMP-Activated Protein Kinases; D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000263: Adenylate Kinase; D000818: Animals; D003345: Corticosterone; D003863: Depression; D004334: Drug Administration Schedule; D004734: Energy Metabolism; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009097: Multienzyme Complexes; D009474: Neurons; D017346: Protein Serine-Threonine Kinases; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D011897: Random Allocation",,,https://openalex.org/W2049431458,158,22,1,1357,216,7
true,activation of mtor dependent signaling pathway is a necessary mechanism of antidepressant-like activity of zinc,"the rapid antidepressant response to the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor antagonists is mediated by activation of the mammalian target of the rapamycin (mtor) signaling pathway, an increase in the synthesis of synaptic proteins and formation of new synapses in the prefrontal cortex (pfc) of rats. zinc (zn), which is a potent nmda receptor antagonist, exerts antidepressant-like effects in screening tests and models of depression. we focused these studies in investigating whether activation of the mtor signaling pathway is also a necessary mechanism of the antidepressant-like activity of zn. we observed that a single injection of zn (5 mg/kg) induced an increase in the phosphorylation of mtor and p70s6k 30 min and 3 h after zn treatment at time points when zn produced also an antidepressant-like effect in the forced swim test (fst). furthermore, zn administered 3 h before the decapitation increased the level of brain derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf), glua1 and synapsin i. an elevated level of glua1 and synapsin i was still observed 24 h after the zn treatment, although zn did not produce any effects in the fst at that time point. we also observed that pretreatment with rapamycin (mtorc1 inhibitor), ly294002 (pi3k inhibitor), h-89 (pka inhibitor) and gf109203x (pkc inhibitor) blocked the antidepressant-like effect of zn in fst in rats and blocks zn-induced activation of mtor signaling proteins (analyzed 30 min after zn administration). these studies indicated that the antidepressant-like activity of zn depends on the activation of mtor signaling and other signaling pathways related to neuroplasticity, which can indirectly modulate mtor function.",Szewczyk B,2015,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.08.026,26297535,Szewczyk B; Pochwat B; Rafało A; Palucha-Poniewiera A; Domin H; Nowak G,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D019208: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; D017868: Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D008297: Male; D000076222: Mechanistic Target of Rapamycin Complex 1; D046912: Multiprotein Complexes; D019869: Phosphatidylinositol 3-Kinases; D000081082: Phosphoinositide-3 Kinase Inhibitors; D010766: Phosphorylation; D017397: Prefrontal Cortex; D011493: Protein Kinase C; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D038762: Ribosomal Protein S6 Kinases, 70-kDa; D015398: Signal Transduction; D016704: Synapsins; D058570: TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; D015032: Zinc",,,https://openalex.org/W1136508987,111,15,1,1677,296,8

false,"a new perspective for schizophrenia: taar1 agonists reveal antipsychotic- and antidepressant-like activity, improve cognition and control body weight","schizophrenia is a chronic, severe and highly complex mental illness. current treatments manage the positive symptoms, yet have minimal effects on the negative and cognitive symptoms, two prominent features of the disease with critical impact on the long-term morbidity. in addition, antipsychotic treatments trigger serious side effects that precipitate treatment discontinuation. here, we show that activation of the trace amine-associated receptor 1 (taar1), a modulator of monoaminergic neurotransmission, represents a novel therapeutic option. in rodents, activation of taar1 by two novel and pharmacologically distinct compounds, the full agonist ro5256390 and the partial agonist ro5263397, blocks psychostimulant-induced hyperactivity and produces a brain activation pattern reminiscent of the antipsychotic drug olanzapine, suggesting antipsychotic-like properties. taar1 agonists do not induce catalepsy or weight gain; ro5263397 even reduced haloperidol-induced catalepsy and prevented olanzapine from increasing body weight and fat accumulation. finally, taar1 activation promotes vigilance in rats and shows pro-cognitive and antidepressant-like properties in rodent and primate models. these data suggest that taar1 agonists may provide a novel and differentiated treatment of schizophrenia as compared with current medication standards: taar1 agonists may improve not only the positive symptoms but also the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits, without causing adverse effects such as motor impairments or weight gain.",Revel FG,2013,Mol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/mp.2012.57,22641180,Revel FG; Moreau JL; Pouzet B; Mory R; Bradaia A; Buchy D; Metzler V; Chaboz S; Groebke Zbinden K; Galley G; Norcross RD; Tuerck D; Bruns A; Morairty SR; Kilduff TS; Wallace TL; Risterucci C; Wettstein JG; Hoener MC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001288: Attention; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D001835: Body Weight; D003042: Cocaine; D003216: Conditioning, Operant; D003863: Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D018765: Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors; D004569: Electroencephalography; D006213: Hallucinogens; D006220: Haloperidol; D006801: Humans; D008252: Macaca fascicularis; D008279: Magnetic Resonance Imaging; D008297: Male; D011939: Mental Recall; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D008822: Mice, Transgenic; D008845: Microinjections; D009043: Motor Activity; D009154: Mutation; D000077152: Olanzapine; D009865: Oocytes; D010080: Oxazoles; D010622: Phencyclidine; D010627: Phenethylamines; D011485: Protein Binding; D011760: Pyrrolidinones; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D043562: Receptors, G-Protein-Coupled; D012054: Reinforcement, Psychology; D012559: Schizophrenia; D013550: Swimming; D013686: Telemetry; D014316: Tritium; D014981: Xenopus",,,https://openalex.org/W2011355421,149,20,1,1538,228,8
false,regulation of depotentiation and long-term potentiation in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats by dopamine d2-like receptors,"dopamine receptors are significantly involved in hippocampus-based cognitive processes. whereas the involvement of d1-like receptors in hippocampal plasticity has been described, the role of d2-like receptors remains to be clarified. therefore, we investigated the contribution of d2-like receptors to synaptic transmission, long-term potentiation (ltp) and depotentiation in the dentate gyrus of freely moving rats. male wistar rats underwent chronic implantation of a recording electrode in the granule cell layer, a stimulating electrode in the medial perforant path and a cannula in the ipsilateral cerebral ventricle (to enable drug administration). the d2-like receptor agonists quinpirole and noraporphine dose-dependently inhibited basal synaptic transmission. agonist priming of d2-like receptors with a drug concentration which had no effect on synaptic transmission inhibited depotentiation but did not affect ltp. the agonist effects on depotentiation were prevented by the d2-like antagonist remoxipride. remoxipride itself did not influence basal synaptic transmission or depotentiation. interestingly, 'weak' ltp (<4 h) but not 'strong' ltp (>24 h) was inhibited by prior application of remoxipride. these results suggest a specific role for dopamine d2-like receptors in the regulation of both depotentiation and ltp in vivo and offer an important and novel insight as to the involvement of these receptors in processes related to learning and memory.",Manahan-Vaughan D,2003,Cereb Cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/13.2.123,12507943,Manahan-Vaughan D; Kulla A,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001058: Apomorphine; D018891: Dentate Gyrus; D018491: Dopamine Agonists; D018492: Dopamine Antagonists; D065127: Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004594: Electrophysiology; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008297: Male; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D019257: Quinpirole; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D017448: Receptors, Dopamine D2; D017330: Remoxipride; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2156469669,128,18,1,1467,232,10
false,fractalkine/cx3cl1 enhances gaba synaptic activity at serotonin neurons in the rat dorsal raphe nucleus,"serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine; 5-ht) has an important role in mood regulation, and its dysfunction in the central nervous system (cns) is associated with depression. reports of mood and immune disorder co-morbidities indicate that immune-5-ht interactions may mediate depression present in immune compromised disease states including hiv/aids, multiple sclerosis, and parkinson's disease. chemokines, immune proteins that induce chemotaxis and cellular adhesion, and their g-protein coupled receptors distribute throughout the cns, regulate neuronal patterning, and mediate neuropathology. the purpose of this study is to investigate the neuroanatomical and neurophysiological relationship between the chemokine fractalkine/cx3cl1 and its receptor cx3cr1 with 5-ht neurons in the rat midbrain raphe nuclei (rn). immunohistochemistry was used to examine the colocalization of cx3cl1 or cx3cr1 with 5-ht in the rn, and whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in rat brain slices were used to determine the functional impact of cx3cl1 on 5-ht dorsal raphe nucleus (drn) neurons. greater than 70% of 5-ht neurons colocalize with cx3cl1 and cx3cr1 in the rn. cx3cl1 localizes as discrete puncta throughout the cytoplasm, whereas cx3cr1 concentrates to the perinuclear region of 5-ht neurons and exhibits microglial expression. cx3cl1 and cx3cr1 also colocalize with one another on individual rn cells. electrophysiology studies indicate a cx3cl1-mediated enhancement of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic current (sipsc) amplitude and dose-dependent increase of evoked ipsc (eipsc) amplitude without affecting eipsc paired-pulse ratio, a finding observed selectively in 5-ht neurons. cx3cl1's effect on eipsc amplitude is blocked by pretreatment with an anti-cx3cl1 neutralizing antibody. thus, cx3cl1 enhances postsynaptic gaba receptor number or sensitivity on 5-ht drn neurons under conditions of both spontaneous and synaptically-evoked gaba release. cx3cl1 may indirectly inhibit 5-ht neurotransmission by increasing the sensitivity of 5-ht drn neurons to gaba inputs. therapies targeting cx3cl1 may treat serotonin related mood disorders, including depression experienced by patients with compromised immune systems.",Heinisch S,2009,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.08.075,19748551,Heinisch S; Kirby LG,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D054428: Chemokine CX3CL1; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D007154: Immune System Diseases; D008297: Male; D008636: Mesencephalon; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009474: Neurons; D011903: Raphe Nuclei; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D012701: Serotonin; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D015854: Up-Regulation; D005680: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W1973041420,103,14,1,2213,338,13

false,effect of vagus nerve stimulation on serotonergic and noradrenergic transmission,"vagus nerve stimulation (vns) is an antiepileptic treatment, which has recently shown promise as an antidepressant. yet, its antidepressant mechanisms of action are unknown. serotonergic [5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht, serotonin)] and noradrenergic [norepinephrine (ne)] systems are involved in the pathophysiology of depression and in the mechanisms of action of antidepressants. the present study analyzes 5-ht and ne neuronal firing rates in their brainstem nuclei: the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn) and locus coeruleus (lc), respectively. the basal firing rates in the drn and lc were significantly increased after long-term treatments with vns. after short-term vns treatments, firing rates were significantly higher for lc (at 1 h and 3 days). as changes in their firing rate may have been due to altered autoreceptor sensitivities, the responses of autoreceptors to the acute administration of their respective agonists were assessed. however, no significant difference was seen in the drn. no significant differences in dose response curves for 5-ht(1a) somatodendritic and alpha 2-adrenergic autoreceptors were noticed between long-term vns and controls. vns appears to have a novel mechanism of antidepressant action, enabling its effectiveness in treatment-resistant depression. lc firing rates significantly increase earlier than the drn basal firing. as the lc has an excitatory influence on drn, it is possible that the increased drn firing rate is secondary to an initial increased lc firing rate from vns.",Dorr AE,2006,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.106.104166,16690723,Dorr AE; Debonnel G,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D058647: Adrenergic alpha-2 Receptor Agonists; D000316: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; D000758: Anesthesia; D000818: Animals; D017660: Autoreceptors; D002452: Cell Count; D003000: Clonidine; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D004594: Electrophysiology; D005110: Extracellular Space; D005727: Ganglia, Spinal; D007700: Kinetics; D008125: Locus Coeruleus; D008238: Lysergic Acid Diethylamide; D008297: Male; D009638: Norepinephrine; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D044282: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A; D018341: Receptors, Adrenergic, alpha-2; D012701: Serotonin; D017366: Serotonin Receptor Agonists; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D014630: Vagus Nerve",,,https://openalex.org/W2078790407,80,10,1,1514,261,12
false,reduction of calcium-independent transient outward potassium current density in doca salt hypertrophied rat ventricular myocytes,"saline-drinking, left-nephrectomized rats made hypertensive by deoxycorticosterone acetate (doca) pellet implantation at the time of surgery develop a cardiac hypertrophy, which becomes maximal after 6-7 weeks. the hypertrophy results in a marked increase in the amplitude and duration of both the early and the late component of the ventricular action potential plateau recorded in the isolated perfused rat heart. the 4-aminopyridine(4-ap)-sensitive calcium-independent transient outward potassium current was markedly depressed in hypertrophied ventricular myocytes resulting in a highly significant decrease in current density (from 19.9 +/- 3.5 to 6.4 +/- 3.1 pa/pf at +60 mv). activation/voltage and steady-state inactivation/voltage relationships were moderately although non-significantly shifted towards negative potentials. the steady-state outward current measured at the end of 1-s depolarizing pulses was not significantly changed in hypertrophied myocytes. 4-ap induced a smaller increase in plateau amplitude and duration in hypertrophied rather than in control hearts, a point that is well explained by the depression of the transient outward current resulting from hypertrophy. we also demonstrated that a complete recovery of both cell capacitance and transient outward current amplitude occurs in myocytes from saline-drinking rats studied 13 weeks after doca pellet implantation, showing that hypertrophy regresses as a result of pellet elimination. several mechanisms can be involved in the observed phenomena, including the possibility that the expression of potassium channels responsible for the transient outward current is not enhanced by hypertrophy in contrast with what occurs in the case of calcium channels.(abstract truncated at 250 words)",Coulombe A,1994,Pflugers Arch,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00585941,8058475,Coulombe A; Momtaz A; Richer P; Swynghedauw B; Coraboeuf E,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D006332: Cardiomegaly; D003900: Desoxycorticosterone; D004553: Electric Conductivity; D006706: Homeostasis; D008297: Male; D009206: Myocardium; D009392: Nephrectomy; D011188: Potassium; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D012965: Sodium Chloride; D016276: Ventricular Function",,,https://openalex.org/W2002221710,128,15,1,1771,267,9
true,the role of the extracellular signal-regulated kinase signaling pathway in mood modulation,"the neurobiological underpinnings of mood modulation, molecular pathophysiology of manic-depressive illness, and therapeutic mechanism of mood stabilizers are largely unknown. the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (erk) pathway is activated by neurotrophins and other neuroactive chemicals to produce their effects on neuronal differentiation, survival, regeneration, and structural and functional plasticity. we found that lithium and valproate, commonly used mood stabilizers for the treatment of manic-depressive illness, stimulated the erk pathway in the rat hippocampus and frontal cortex. both drugs increased the levels of activated phospho-erk44/42, activated phospho-ribosomal protein s6 kinase-1 (rsk1) (a substrate of erk), phospho-creb (camp response element-binding protein) and phospho-b cell lymphoma protein-2 antagonist of cell death (substrates of rsk), and bdnf. inhibiting the erk pathway with the blood-brain barrier-penetrating mitogen-activated protein kinase (map kinase)/erk kinase (mek) kinase inhibitor sl327, but not with the nonblood-brain barrier-penetrating mek inhibitor u0126, decreased immobility time and increased swimming time of rats in the forced-swim test. sl327, but not u0126, also increased locomotion time and distance traveled in a large open field. the behavioral changes in the open field were prevented with chronic lithium pretreatment. sl327-induced behavioral changes are qualitatively similar to the changes induced by amphetamine, a compound that induces relapse in remitted manic patients and mood elevation in normal subjects. these data suggest that the erk pathway may mediate the antimanic effects of mood stabilizers.",Einat H,2003,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.23-19-07311.2003,12917364,Einat H; Yuan P; Gould TD; Li J; Du J; Zhang L; Manji HK; Chen G,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000339: Affect; D000607: Aminoacetonitrile; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D018692: Antimanic Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001714: Bipolar Disorder; D002490: Central Nervous System; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D005625: Frontal Lobe; D006624: Hippocampus; D016651: Lithium Carbonate; D008124: Locomotion; D020935: MAP Kinase Signaling System; D008297: Male; D020929: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase Kinases; D020928: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinases; D009154: Mutation; D011480: Protease Inhibitors; D051381: Rats; D013550: Swimming; D014635: Valproic Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W2146918064,90,12,1,1680,262,9

true,decreased 5-ht1a and increased 5-ht2a receptor binding after chronic corticosterone associated with a behavioural indication of depression but not anxiety,"the effects of chronic corticosterone treatment (100 mg pellet implanted for 1 week) were assessed in animal tests of anxiety, exploration and motor activity, and changes in binding to 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors, and the 5-ht transporter, were measured. at the end of the week's treatment, the corticosterone concentration was significantly elevated and there were significant decreases in adrenal, thymus and body weights. however, there were no changes in the measures of anxiety in the social interaction test or on trials 1 and 2 of the elevated plus-maze. also supporting a dissociation between anxiety and elevated corticosterone concentrations are previous findings that benzodiazepine withdrawal causes increased anxiety but no change in corticosteroid concentrations. therefore these two situations provide a double dissociation between anxiety and elevated corticosteroids. decreased 5-ht1a receptor binding in the dentate gyrus and increased 5-ht2a receptor binding in the parietal cortex was found following chronic corticosterone treatment. this reciprocal relationship between 5-ht1a and 5-ht2a receptors has been proposed to be important in mediating depression. the significant decreases in motor activity observed in all the test situations would be compatible with this proposal. thus the constellation of behavioural and biochemical changes detected after chronic corticosterone treatment is more pertinent to depression than anxiety. one week after removal of the pellets, the behavioural and neurochernical changes had disappeared and the only differences to remain were decreased adrenal, thymus and body weights in the animals that had been treated chronically with corticosterone.",Fernandes C,1997,Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0306-4530(97)00052-8,9373882,Fernandes C; McKittrick CR; File SE; McEwen BS,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D000893: Anti-Inflammatory Agents; D001007: Anxiety; D001345: Autoradiography; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001835: Body Weight; D003345: Corticosterone; D003863: Depression; D005106: Exploratory Behavior; D007398: Interpersonal Relations; D008297: Male; D009929: Organ Size; D051381: Rats; D011985: Receptors, Serotonin",,,https://openalex.org/W2087504641,154,20,1,1705,263,10
false,changes of paired-pulse evoked responses during the development of epileptic activity in the hippocampus,"dysfunction of inhibitory synaptic transmission can destroy the balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs in neurons, thereby inducing epileptic activity. the aim of the paper is to investigate the effects of successive excitatory inputs on the epileptic activity induced in the absence of inhibitions. paired-pulse orthodromic and antidromic stimulations were used to test the changes in the evoked responses in the hippocampus. picrotoxin (ptx), γ-aminobutyric acid (gaba) type a (gabaa) receptor antagonist, was added to block the inhibitory synaptic transmission and to establish the epileptic model. extracellular evoked population spike (ps) was recorded in the ca1 region of the hippocampus. the results showed that the application of ptx induced a biphasic change in the paired-pulse ratio of ps amplitude. a short latency increase of the second ps (ps2) was later followed by a reappearance of ps2 depression. this type of depression was observed in both orthodromic and antidromic paired-pulse responses, whereas the gabaergic ps2 depression [called paired-pulse depression (ppd)] during baseline recordings only appeared in orthodromic-evoked responses. in addition, the depression duration at approximately 100 ms was consistent with a relative silent period observed within spontaneous burst discharges induced by prolonged application of ptx. in conclusion, the neurons may ignore the excitatory inputs and intrinsically generate bursts during epileptic activity. the depolarization block could be the mechanisms underlying the ppd in the absence of gabaa inhibitions. the distinct neuronal responses to stimulations during different epileptic stages may implicate the different antiepileptic effects of electrical stimulation.",Feng ZY,2011,J Zhejiang Univ Sci B,https://doi.org/10.1631/jzus.b1000316,21887845,Feng ZY; Zheng XJ; Tian C; Wang Y; Xing HY,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D004827: Epilepsy; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D058787: GABA-A Receptor Antagonists; D006624: Hippocampus; D006801: Humans; D009474: Neurons; D010852: Picrotoxin; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W1969510398,104,14,1,1757,278,12
false,the effects of endomorphin-1 on conditioned defeat in syrian hamsters (mesocricetus auratus),"the present study examined the effect of endomorphin-1 (em1), an endogenous opioid with a high affinity for the mu opiate receptor, on conditioned defeat. conditioned defeat is a phenomenon in which hamsters that have been defeated subsequently fail to exhibit normal territorial aggression and instead display submissive/defensive behaviors even when paired with a non-aggressive intruder. in experiment 1, animals were placed in the home cage of a larger resident for 15 min and were defeated. after 24 h, animals received a 3-microl injection of em1 (0.0, 0.3, 3.0, or 10 nmol) into the left lateral cerebral ventricle 5 min before a smaller non-aggressive intruder was placed in the home cage of the experimental animal. in experiment 2, animals were infused with em1 immediately after the initial defeat and were paired with a non-aggressive intruder 24 h later as in experiment 1. em1 reduced the duration of submissive/defensive behavior in experiment 1 (p<0.05) but not in experiment 2 (p>0.05). these data support the hypothesis that the highly selective mu receptor agonist endomorphin-1 modulates the expression of conditioned defeat, but provides no support for the hypothesis that endomorphin-1 modulates the consolidation of conditioned defeat.",Whitten RD,2001,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-8993(01)02775-5,11578599,Whitten RD; Jasnow AM; Albers HE; Martin-Schild S; Zadina JE; Huhman KL,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001007: Anxiety; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001921: Brain; D003213: Conditioning, Psychological; D006224: Cricetinae; D003863: Depression; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005239: Fear; D007276: Injections, Intraventricular; D008297: Male; D008647: Mesocricetus; D009842: Oligopeptides; D017450: Receptors, Opioid, mu; D013315: Stress, Psychological",,,https://openalex.org/W2006856101,92,14,1,1258,220,7

false,alkaline phosphatase in boar sperm function,"alkaline phosphatase (ap) catalyses the detachment of phosphate residues from different substrates. its activity has been demonstrated in seminal plasma and spermatozoa from porcine and other mammalian species; anyway, the role of ap in male reproduction has not been clarified yet and the aim of this study was to determine ap function in boar sperm capacitation and in vitro fertilization (ivf). ap activity was assayed in seminal plasma and in uncapacitated and in vitro capacitated (ivc) spermatozoa; in addition, capacitation was studied in presence of different doses of ap (1.2 and 2.5 iu/ml). the effect of different doses of ap (1.2 and 2.5 iu/ml) on several sperm parameters after ivc (viability, acrosome integrity with fitc-psa, capacitation status with ctc staining, tyrosine phosphorylation) and on fertilizing ability during ivf were also evaluated. high ap activity was detected in seminal plasma, in particular in sperm-rich fraction; a lower activity was detected in uncapacitated spermatozoa while a significant decrease was evidenced after ivc. viability was not changed by ap supplementation of the capacitating medium, whereas acrosome integrity and capacitation status were significantly affected by 1.2 and 2.5 doses, with a dose-dependent decrease in acrosome-reacted cells as well as in ctc b pattern displaying cells. as for sperm head protein phosphorylation, a decrease in relative fluorescence was detected in ap 2.5 group, if compared with capacitated one. after ivf, a dose-dependent decrease in penetrated oocytes was recorded, with an increase in monospermic zygote rate. in conclusion, we demonstrated that ap activity decreases under capacitating condition and that addition of ap to spermatozoa during capacitation results in a depression of the capacitating process and ivf. we can infer that ap plays a role in keeping spermatozoa quiescent until they are ejaculated and in modulating the acquisition of the fertilizing ability.",Bucci D,2014,Andrology,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.2047-2927.2013.00159.x,24249651,Bucci D; Isani G; Giaretta E; Spinaci M; Tamanini C; Ferlizza E; Galeati G,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000177: Acrosome; D000469: Alkaline Phosphatase; D000818: Animals; D005306: Fertilization; D005307: Fertilization in Vitro; D008297: Male; D010766: Phosphorylation; D012661: Semen; D013075: Sperm Capacitation; D013077: Sperm Head; D013094: Spermatozoa; D034421: Sus scrofa,,,https://openalex.org/W2016229586,43,6,1,1967,333,10

false,sphingomyelinase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus in mouse diaphragm muscle fibers,"diseases that result in muscle weakness, e.g., heart failure, are characterized by elevated sphingomyelinase (smase) activity. in intact muscle, smase increases oxidants that contribute to diminished muscle force. however, the source of oxidants, specific processes of muscle contraction that are dysfunctional, and biochemical changes underlying the weakness elicited by smase remain unknown. we tested three hypotheses: 1) smase-induced depression of muscle force is mediated by mitochondrial reactive oxygen species (ros), 2) smase depresses force and calcium sensitivity of the contractile apparatus, and 3) smase promotes oxidation and phosphorylation of myofibrillar proteins. our experiments included intact muscle bundles, permeabilized single fibers, and isolated myofibrillar proteins. the mitochondrial-targeted antioxidant d-arg-2′,6′-dimethyl-tyr-lys-phe-nh 2 , decreased cytosolic oxidants and protected intact muscle bundles from weakness stimulated by smase. smase depressed maximal calcium-activated force by 20% in permeabilized single fibers (in kn/m 2 : control 117 ± 6; smase 93 ± 8; p < 0.05). calcium sensitivity of permeabilized single fibers decreased from 5.98 ± 0.03 (control) to 5.91 ± 0.02 (smase; p < 0.05). myofibrillar protein nitrotyrosines, carbonyls, and phosphorylation were unaltered by smase. our study shows that the fall in specific force of intact muscle elicited by smase is mediated by mitochondrial ros and can be attributed largely to dysfunction of the contractile apparatus.",Ferreira LF,2012,J Appl Physiol (1985),https://doi.org/10.1152/japplphysiol.01269.2011,22362402,Ferreira LF; Moylan JS; Stasko S; Smith JD; Campbell KS; Reid MB,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000975: Antioxidants; D020013: Calcium Signaling; D002463: Cell Membrane Permeability; D003600: Cytosol; D003964: Diaphragm; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D056966: Excitation Contraction Coupling; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D008931: Mitochondria, Muscle; D009119: Muscle Contraction; D018485: Muscle Fibers, Skeletal; D053580: Muscle Strength; D009210: Myofibrils; D010084: Oxidation-Reduction; D018384: Oxidative Stress; D010766: Phosphorylation; D050050: Protein Carbonylation; D011499: Protein Processing, Post-Translational; D017382: Reactive Oxygen Species; D013108: Sphingomyelin Phosphodiesterase; D014443: Tyrosine",,,https://openalex.org/W2126841723,118,15,1,1527,255,10

false,fluoxetine protects hippocampal plasticity during conditioned fear stress and prevents fear learning potentiation,"rationale: contextual fear conditioning can produce both changes in hippocampal synaptic efficacy and potentiation of subsequent fear learning.
objectives: in this study, we tested whether fluoxetine reverses these effects.
materials and methods: in the first experiment, we examined alterations of baseline synaptic efficacy and induction of synaptic plasticity in the ca3 region of the hippocampus during re-exposure of rats, treated with fluoxetine (7 mg/kg) or vehicle, in a context where they previously received 15 eyelid shocks or no shock (controls). in the second experiment, fear learning potentiation was examined in rats that were initially submitted to conditioning (15 eyelid shocks) and extinction training and then re-exposed to a less intense stressor (three eyelid shocks).
results: conditioned fear stress decreased synaptic efficacy and blocked the induction of synaptic potentiation in the fimbria-ca3 pathway. conditioned rats treated with fluoxetine were protected against these electrophysiological changes and did not differ from controls (i.e., no depression and normal induction of potentiation of synaptic efficacy). however, fluoxetine treatment did not suppress conditioned freezing. after fear extinction, exposure of rats to a subconditioning stressor provoked conditioning (fear learning potentiation) in rats treated with vehicle but not in those treated with fluoxetine.
conclusions: these findings indicate that fluoxetine treatment, which is ineffective on conditioned fear stress-induced freezing, may have beneficial effects on conditioned fear stress-induced disturbance of hippocampal plasticity. these data also suggest that restoration of hippocampal functioning may contribute to protection against exaggerated reactions to mild stressors reported in patients with post-traumatic stress disorder.",Spennato G,2008,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-007-0993-7,17992518,Spennato G; Zerbib C; Mondadori C; Garcia R,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D003213: Conditioning, Psychological; D004597: Electroshock; D005143: Eyelids; D005239: Fear; D005473: Fluoxetine; D006624: Hippocampus; D007858: Learning; D008297: Male; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D013315: Stress, Psychological",,,https://openalex.org/W2035132074,113,13,1,1844,285,10

false,regulation of pre-transfer rna synthesis during transition from resting to growing state,"the rate of synthesis of pre-trna has been examined in detergent-treated ghost monolayers of 3t6 cells prepared from cultures undergoing a transition from resting to growing state. for the first 30 min after serum stimulation of resting cells, the rate of pre-trna synthesis rises together with the rate of pre-rrna synthesis; but later, synthesis of pre-trna fails to increase in proportion to that of pre-rrna. after replication of dna begins, the rate of pre-trna synthesis increases more sharply than that of pre-rrna, and by 24 hr the initial proportion in their rates of synthesis is reestablished. if dna replication is prevented by cytosine arabinoside, the discrepancy in the rates of pre-rrna and pre-trna synthesis persists. as a result, cells stimulated with serum in the presence of cytosine arabinoside develop a form of unbalanced growth in which there is an increasing deficit in the amount of trna relative to other classes of rna in the cytoplasm. the rate of protein synthesis soon fails to increase, suggesting that it may be limited by the availability of trna. these facts may have a bearing on the normal operation of the division cycle. pre-trna synthesis can evidently be regulated only over a narrow range without dna replication. when ribosomes and mrna accumulate during the transition from resting to growing state, and the rate of protein synthesis increases, control of the division cycle evidently ensures that dna replication will begin before cellular trna content becomes much reduced relative to its ribosome content. the regulatory range for transcription of pre-trna (independent of increase in the number of genes through replication) can also be demonstrated by using inhibitors of protein synthesis. resting cells respond to such inhibitors by increasing their rate of synthesis of pre-trna, whereas cells already stimulated by serum do not respond further.",Mauck JC,1974,Cell,https://doi.org/10.1016/0092-8674(74)90122-6,4473272,Mauck JC; Green H,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D002250: Carbon Radioisotopes; D002455: Cell Division; D002460: Cell Line; D002848: Chromatography, DEAE-Cellulose; D003513: Cycloheximide; D003561: Cytarabine; D004247: DNA; D004261: DNA Replication; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004591: Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; D005347: Fibroblasts; D051379: Mice; D008815: Mice, Inbred Strains; D014176: Protein Biosynthesis; D011691: Puromycin; D012343: RNA, Transfer; D013997: Time Factors; D014158: Transcription, Genetic; D014316: Tritium; D014500: Uracil Nucleotides",,,https://openalex.org/W1999144340,88,12,1,1898,322,11

false,cysteine sulfinic acid can enhance the central depressant effect of ethanol in mice,"the interaction between ethanol and cysteine sulfinic acid was examined in male swiss-webster mice. the loss of the righting reflex (lorr) was used as a measurement of central nervous system depression. in addition, the interaction between ethanol and cysteic acid, a metabolite of cysteine sulfinic acid, was studied. immediately after the animals regained the righting reflex following ethanol injection (ip), mice were given an icv injection of saline, cysteine sulfinic acid (1, 15 or 25 mumol/kg) or cysteic acid (1, 15, or 25 mumol/kg). there occurred a return to the lorr within 30 s after the icv injection of drugs. the return to the lorr by the administration of the amino acids in the presence of ethanol occurred in a dose-dependent fashion. when cysteine sulfinic acid or cysteic acid (25 mumol/kg, icv) was injected in the absence of ethanol, no loss of the righting reflex occurred. in other experiments, bicuculline methiodide was given icv with cysteine sulfinic acid (25 mumol/kg), cysteic acid (25 mumol/kg), or gaba (25 mumol/kg) in the presence of ethanol. bicuculline methiodide, a gaba antagonist, reduced the effects of the three amino acids to produce a return to the lorr in the presence of ethanol. these results indicate that cysteine sulfinic acid, an excitatory amino acid, and cysteic acid can enhance the central depressant properties of ethanol. since bicuculline antagonized the effects of these two amino acids, a gabaergic mechanism may be involved in the interaction between ethanol and cysteine sulfinic acid or cysteic acid.",Ferko AP,1991,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/0091-3057(91)90142-o,1686102,Ferko AP,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001640: Bicuculline; D002492: Central Nervous System Depressants; D003544: Cysteic Acid; D003545: Cysteine; D004357: Drug Synergism; D000431: Ethanol; D018756: GABA Antagonists; D007276: Injections, Intraventricular; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D018377: Neurotransmitter Agents; D004856: Postural Balance",,,https://openalex.org/W2001445635,83,13,1,1563,293,11
false,nt-3 increases amplitude of epsps produced by axotomized group ia afferents,we tested the hypothesis that neurotrophin-3 (nt-3) in adult cats can rescue the central synapses made by muscle afferents from the effects of peripheral axotomy. the medial gastrocnemius (mg) muscle nerve in cats was axotomized and capped or axotomized and the distal end provided with either saline or nt-3 by mini-osmotic pump. four to five weeks later monosynaptic excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) elicited by electrical stimulation of the axotomized mg nerve were recorded in intact lateral gastrocnemius/soleus (lgs) motoneurons. the axotomized mg afferents without nt-3 treatment generated epsps averaging one-half of the amplitude of those generated by normal intact mg afferents. axotomized mg afferents treated with nt-3 elicited epsps averaging 2.5 times normal amplitude and 5 times the amplitude of those from afferents axotomized but not treated. the very large epsps generated by nt-3-treated afferents remained as susceptible to depression during high-frequency stimulation (32 shocks at 167 hz) as those elicited by untreated axotomized afferents. the arrival of the afferent volley of the cord dorsum potential and the onset of epsps were both delayed by axotomy of the group ia afferents and were both restored by exposure to nt-3. this result suggests that the conduction velocity and thus the caliber of group ia afferents are also controlled by nt-3. we conclude that the neurotrophin nt-3 has a continuing role in the maintenance of physiological function of muscle afferents in adult mammals.,Munson JB,1997,J Neurophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.1997.77.4.2209,9114268,Munson JB; Johnson RD; Mendell LM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001369: Axons; D002415: Cats; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D005260: Female; D009046: Motor Neurons; D009470: Muscle Spindles; D009412: Nerve Fibers; D009414: Nerve Growth Factors; D009475: Neurons, Afferent; D020933: Neurotrophin 3",,,https://openalex.org/W2440975384,75,11,1,1526,250,9

false,heterogeneity of metabotropic glutamate receptors in the striatum: electrophysiological evidence,"in order to investigate the functional role of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) in the striatum we performed extracellular and intracellular recordings from a corticostriatal brain slice preparation. the effects of l-2-amino-3-phosphopropionic acid (l-ap3), an antagonist of mglurs, were studied both on long-term synaptic depression (ltd) and on presynaptic inhibition of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) induced by different agonists of mglurs. l-ap3 produced a dose-dependent (3-30 microm) reduction of the ltd evoked in the striatum by the tetanic stimulation of the corticostriatal pathway. in contrast to this action, l-ap3 (10-100 microm) did not significantly affect the presynaptic inhibitory effect of 1-amino-cyclopentyl-trans-dicarboxylic acid (t-acpd), an agonist of mglurs, on corticostriatal transmission. higher concentrations of l-ap3 (0.3-1 mm) reduced by themselves the epsp amplitude. the inhibitory effect of t-acpd on the cortically evoked epsps was mimicked either by the active stereoisomer 1s,3r-acpd or by amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid (l-ap4), a glutamate autoreceptor agonist. in some neurons, these inhibitory actions were coupled with membrane depolarizations. the depression of synaptic transmission caused by t-acpd, 1s,3r-acpd and l-ap4 was not altered following the induction of ltd. chronic lithium treatment of the animals (60-120 mg/kg i.p. for 10 days) blocked striatal ltd but not presynaptic inhibition mediated by mglur agonists. the present findings show that the mechanisms underlying ltd and the presynaptic inhibition induced by different agonists of mglurs exhibit functional and pharmacological differences. these data suggest heterogeneity of mglurs in the striatum.",Calabresi P,1993,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.1993.tb00923.x,8275236,Calabresi P; Pisani A; Mercuri NB; Bernardi G,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000409: Alanine; D000613: Aminobutyrates; D000818: Animals; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D003342: Corpus Striatum; D003515: Cycloleucine; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D018021: Lithium Chloride; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009943: Organophosphorus Compounds; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D017470: Receptors, Glutamate; D013237: Stereoisomerism; D013569: Synapses",,,https://openalex.org/W2136726936,96,11,1,1733,274,12
true,deuterium content of water increases depression susceptibility: the potential role of a serotonin-related mechanism,"environmental factors can significantly affect disease prevalence, including neuropsychiatric disorders such as depression. the ratio of deuterium to protium in water shows substantial geographical variation, which could affect disease susceptibility. thus the link between deuterium content of water and depression was investigated, both epidemiologically, and in a mouse model of chronic mild stress. we performed a correlation analysis between deuterium content of tap water and rates of depression in regions of the usa. next, we used a 10-day chronic stress paradigm to test whether 2-week deuterium-depleted water treatment (91 ppm) affects depressive-like behavior and hippocampal sert. the effect of deuterium-depletion on sleep electrophysiology was also evaluated in naïve mice. there was a geographic correlation between a content of deuterium and the prevalence of depression across the usa. in the chronic stress model, depressive-like features were reduced in mice fed with deuterium-depleted water, and sert expression was decreased in mice treated with deuterium-treated water compared with regular water. five days of predator stress also suppressed proliferation in the dentate gyrus; this effect was attenuated in mice fed with deuterium-depleted water. finally, in naïve mice, deuterium-depleted water treatment increased eeg indices of wakefulness, and decreased duration of rem sleep, phenomena that have been shown to result from the administration of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssri). our data suggest that the deuterium content of water may influence the incidence of affective disorder-related pathophysiology and major depression, which might be mediated by the serotoninergic mechanisms.",Strekalova T,2015,Behav Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2014.07.039,25092571,Strekalova T; Evans M; Chernopiatko A; Couch Y; Costa-Nunes J; Cespuglio R; Chesson L; Vignisse J; Steinbusch HW; Anthony DC; Pomytkin I; Lesch KP,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D003863: Depression; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D003903: Deuterium; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004198: Disease Susceptibility; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D012701: Serotonin; D050486: Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D014867: Water",,,https://openalex.org/W2046796618,115,15,1,1729,269,11

false,beta-adrenergic activity and cardiovascular response to severe respiratory acidosis,"the mechanism responsible for the depressive myocardial effects of severe respiratory acidosis is unclear; however, sympathetic stimulation and catecholamines are known to be involved. the influence of beta-adrenergic receptor activity on the myocardial response to severe respiratory acidosis was studied in 18 anesthetized, mechanically ventilated dogs. arterial co2 tension (paco2) was raised by increasing the inspired co2 fraction in o2. in control animals, as paco2 increased, heart rate (hr) decreased (paco2 approximately 110 mmhg), then returned to control (paco2 approximately 220 mmhg), whereas arterial blood pressure (pa) and cardiac output (q) remained unchanged from prehypercapnia levels. at paco2 greater than 350 mmhg, pa, hr, and q decreased and left ventricular function (lvf) curves were depressed. death occurred at a paco2 of 404 +/- 25 mmhg (ph 6.48 +/- 0.02). in a second group of animals, administration of isoproterenol during the increase in paco2 did not result in depression of myocardial function, and death did not occur even at a significantly higher paco2 (paco2 496 +/- 12 mmhg; ph 6.39 +/- 0.02) than in the control group. administration of propranolol to a third group of animals as paco2 increased did not change pa, hr, and q; however, lvf curves indicated a more rapid and severe depression of myocardial performance than in control, and death occurred at a significantly lower paco2 (paco2 220 +/- 25 mmhg; ph 6.65 +/- 0.02). we conclude that beta-adrenergic receptor stimulation can prevent hypercapnic heart failure and that beta-adrenergic receptor activity is involved in the mechanism responsible for this failure.",Steinhart CR,1983,Am J Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpheart.1983.244.1.h46,6295189,Steinhart CR; Permutt S; Gurtner GH; Traystman RJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000142: Acidosis, Respiratory; D000818: Animals; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002245: Carbon Dioxide; D002302: Cardiac Output; D004285: Dogs; D006339: Heart Rate; D006439: Hemodynamics; D007545: Isoproterenol; D011433: Propranolol; D011941: Receptors, Adrenergic; D011943: Receptors, Adrenergic, beta; D014655: Vascular Resistance",,,https://openalex.org/W50230542,83,9,1,1660,301,9

false,"jumping mechanisms in dictyopharid planthoppers (hemiptera, dicytyopharidae)","the jumping performance of four species of hemipterans belonging to the family dictyopharidae, from europe, south africa and australia, were analysed from high-speed images. the body shape in all was characterised by an elongated and tapering head that gave a streamlined appearance. the body size ranged from 6 to 9 mm in length and from 6 to 23 mg in mass. the hind legs were 80-90% of body length and 30-50% longer than the front legs, except in one species in which the front legs were particularly large so that all legs were of similar length. jumping was propelled by rapid and simultaneous depression of the trochantera of both hind legs, powered by large muscles in the thorax, and was accompanied by extension of the tibiae. in the best jumps, defined as those with the fastest take-off velocity, engela minuta accelerated in 1.2 ms to a take-off velocity of 5.8 m s(-1), which is the fastest achieved by any insect described to date. during such a jump, e. minuta experienced an acceleration of 4830 m s(-2) or 490 g, while other species in the same family experienced 225-375 g. the best jumps in all species required an energy expenditure of 76-225 μj, a power output of 12-80 mw and exerted a force of 12-29 mn. the required power output per mass of jumping muscle ranged from 28,000 to 140,200 w kg(-1) muscle and thus greatly exceeded the maximum active contractile limit of normal muscle. to achieve such a jumping performance, these insects must be using a power amplification mechanism in a catapult-like action. it is suggested that their streamlined body shape improves jumping performance by reducing drag, which, for a small insect, can substantially affect forward momentum.",Burrows M,2014,J Exp Biol,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.093476,24198256,Burrows M,article,D016428: Journal Article,D000054: Acceleration; D000818: Animals; D001696: Biomechanical Phenomena; D005121: Extremities; D006430: Hemiptera; D019476: Insect Proteins; D008124: Locomotion,,,https://openalex.org/W2135588379,83,16,1,1698,324,10
false,persistence of pad and presynaptic inhibition of muscle spindle afferents after peripheral nerve crush,"two to twelve weeks after crushing a muscle nerve, still before the damaged afferents reinnervate the muscle receptors, conditioning stimulation of group i fibers from flexor muscles depolarizes the damaged afferents [m. enríquez, i. jimenez, p. rudomin, changes in pad patterns of group i muscle afferents after a peripheral nerve crush. exp. brain res., 107 (1996), 405-420]. it is not known, however, if this primary afferent depolarization (pad) is indeed related to presynaptic inhibition. we now show in the cat that 2–12 weeks after crushing the medial gastrocnemius nerve (mg), conditioning stimulation of group i fibers from flexors increases the excitability of the intraspinal terminals of both the intact lateral gastrocnemius plus soleus (lgs) and of the previously damaged mg fibers ending in the motor pool, because of pad. the pad is associated with the depression of the pre- and postsynaptic components of the extracellular field potentials (efps) evoked in the motor pool by stimulation of either the intact lgs or of the previously damaged mg nerves. these observations indicate, in contrast to what has been reported for crushed cutaneous afferents [k.w. horch, j.w. lisney, changes in primary afferent depolarization of sensory neurones during peripheral nerve regeneration in the cat, j. physiol., 313 (1981), 287-299], that shortly after damaging their peripheral axons, the synaptic efficacy of group i spindle afferents remains under central control. presynaptic inhibitory mechanisms could be utilized to adjust the central actions of muscle afferents not fully recovered from peripheral lesions.",Enríquez-Denton M,2004,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2004.08.058,15494169,Enríquez-Denton M; Manjarrez E; Rudomin P,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D009470: Muscle Spindles; D018482: Muscle, Skeletal; D009409: Nerve Crush; D009431: Neural Conduction; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D010523: Peripheral Nervous System Diseases; D017729: Presynaptic Terminals; D051381: Rats; D013116: Spinal Cord; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2074333256,102,14,1,1623,290,11

false,depression of release by mglur8 alters ca2+ dependence of release machinery,"the ubiquitous presynaptic metabotropic glutamate receptors (mglurs) are generally believed to primarily inhibit synaptic transmission through blockade of ca(2+) entry. here, we analyzed how mglur8 achieves a nearly complete inhibition of glutamate release at hippocampal synapses. surprisingly, presynaptic ca(2+) imaging and miniature excitatory postsynaptic current recordings showed that mglur8 acts without affecting ca(2+) entry, diffusion, and buffering. we quantitatively compared the ca(2+) dependence of the inhibition of release by mglur8 with the inhibition by ω-conotoxin gvia. these calculations suggest that the inhibition produced by mglur8 may be explained by a decrease in the apparent ca(2+) affinity of the release sensor and, to a smaller extent, by a reduction of the maximal release rate. upon activation of mglur8, phasic transmitter release toward the end of a train of action potentials is greater as compared with presynaptic inhibition induced by blocking ca(2+) entry, which is consistent with the important role of ca(2+) in accelerating the replenishment of released vesicles. the action of mglur8 was resistant to blockers of classical g-protein transduction pathways including inhibition of adenylate cyclase and may represent a direct effect on the release machinery. in conclusion, our data identify a mode of presynaptic inhibition which allows mglur8 to profoundly inhibit vesicle fusion while not diminishing vesicle replenishment and which thereby differentially changes the temporal transmission properties of the inhibited synapse.",Erdmann E,2012,Cereb Cortex,https://doi.org/10.1093/cercor/bhr217,21903594,Erdmann E; Rupprecht V; Matthews E; Kukley M; Schoch S; Dietrich D,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D020013: Calcium Signaling; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D003198: Computer Simulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D008959: Models, Neurological; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D018094: Receptors, Metabotropic Glutamate; D013569: Synapses",,,https://openalex.org/W2135079850,75,11,1,1572,261,8

false,activation of cb1 specifically located on gabaergic interneurons inhibits ltd in the lateral amygdala,"previously, we found that in the lateral amygdala (la) of the mouse, win55,212-2 decreases both glutamatergic and gabaergic synaptic transmission via activation of the cannabinoid receptor type 1 (cb1), yet produces an overall reduction of neuronal excitability. this suggests that the effects on excitatory transmission override those on inhibitory transmission. here we show that cb1 activation by win55,212-2 and delta(9)-thc inhibits long-term depression (ltd) of basal synaptic transmission in the la, induced by low-frequency stimulation (lfs; 900 pulses/1 hz). the cb1 agonist win55,212-2 blocked ltd via g(i/o) proteins, activation of inwardly rectifying k+ channels (k(ir)s), inhibition of the adenylate cyclase-protein kinase a (pka) pathway, and pka-dependent inhibition of voltage-gated n-type ca2+ channels (n-type vgccs). interestingly, win55,212-2 effects on ltd were abolished in cb1 knock-out mice (cb1-ko), and in conditional mutants lacking cb1 expression only in gabaergic interneurons, but were still present in mutants lacking cb1 in principal forebrain neurons. ltd induction per se was unaffected by the cb1 antagonist sr141716a and was normally expressed in cb1-ko as well as in both conditional cb1 mutants. our data demonstrate that activation of cb1 specifically located on gabaergic interneurons inhibits ltd in the la. these findings suggest that cb1 expressed on either glutamatergic or gabaergic neurons play a differential role in the control of synaptic transmission and plasticity.",Azad SC,2008,Learn Mem,https://doi.org/10.1101/lm.741908,18323569,Azad SC; Kurz J; Marsicano G; Lutz B; Zieglgänsberger W; Rammes G,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000679: Amygdala; D000818: Animals; D048588: Benzoxazines; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D020864: Calcium Channels, N-Type; D017868: Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D019206: GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gi-Go; D007395: Interneurons; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D018345: Mice, Knockout; D009025: Morpholines; D009281: Naphthalenes; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D024642: Potassium Channels, Voltage-Gated; D043884: Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; D005680: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W2111103317,101,14,1,1516,261,8

false,effects of estrogen on platelet reactivity after transient forebrain ischemia in rats,"estrogen's prothrombotic effects are of increasing concern, particularly in stroke risk and recovery. using an ischemic rodent model, the authors sought to determine (a) if estrogen replacement increases postischemic platelet reactivity, (b) if changes in estrogen status alter intraplatelet endothelial nitric oxide synthase (enos) synthesis, and (c) if estrogen-mediated effects on platelets alter cerebral blood flow during reperfusion. intact (i), ovariectomized (ovx), and ovx + 17 beta-estradiol (e50) rats were subjected to 30 min of forebrain ischemia and 60 min of reperfusion. using the platelet activation marker p-selectin, postischemic platelet reactivity was quantified by flow cytometry. in a separate cohort (i, ovx, e50), the authors quantified platelet enos by western blot. another cohort (ovx, e50) was subjected to ischemia/reperfusion, and cerebral blood flow was determined using the iodoantipyrine technique. collagen-stimulated platelet p-selectin expression was increased in the ovx rats at 60 min of reperfusion, and this effect was reversed by estrogen treatment. no differences in platelet enos expression were detected among groups. cerebral blood flow at 60 min reperfusion was comparable between the ovx and the e50 rats. the authors conclude that during reper-fusion, estrogen deficiency increases postischemic platelet sensitivity to stimuli in estrogen-deficient rats. estrogen treatment mitigates effects of estrogen loss on platelets, but this early effect is apparently not caused by intraplatelet enos depression. neither estrogen deficiency nor estrogen treatment changes early postischemic regional brain blood flow. in this rodent global cerebral ischemic model, physiologic doses of estrogen are not deleterious to platelet reactivity and may initially reduce postischemic platelet reactivity.",Littleton-Kearney MT,2005,Biol Res Nurs,https://doi.org/10.1177/1099800405276832,16267375,Littleton-Kearney MT; Gaines JM; Callahan KP; Murphy SJ; Hurn PD,article,"D023362: Evaluation Study; D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D001792: Blood Platelets; D002545: Brain Ischemia; D002560: Cerebrovascular Circulation; D015914: Estrogen Replacement Therapy; D004967: Estrogens; D005260: Female; D052250: Nitric Oxide Synthase Type III; D019007: P-Selectin; D015539: Platelet Activation; D016548: Prosencephalon; D011897: Random Allocation; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar",,,https://openalex.org/W2017207988,85,12,1,1836,301,13

false,embryonic development and mitochondrial function,"inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis in rat embryos during late organogenesis leads to impaired embryonic development. 1. thiamphenicol (tap), similar to chloramphenicol, inhibits in vivo the synthesis of cytochrome oxidase (cytox), which is partially synthesized by the mitochondrion. subsequently, dna synthesis and embryonic growth are affected. 2. embryos on day 10 and 11, in contrast to embryos on day 9 of gestation, show a high sensitivity of mitochondrial protein synthesis, measured as cytox activity. from day 10 onwards, such an inhibition leads to pronounced impairment of dna synthesis. the rat hemochorial placenta starts functioning on day 12 of gestation. larger doses of tap are required to inhibit cytox and dna synthesis for treatment after placentation rather than before placentation. 3. dose-response relationships differ depending on the date and duration of treatment. application of tap for 1 day requires 10-30 mg/kg tap to inhibit cytox synthesis and 60-100 mg/kg to impair embryonic growth. prolongation of treatment to 4 days (day 10-13) lowers the dose required for inhibition of dna synthesis to 10 mg tap/kg/day. this is lower than the human therapeutic dose. larger doses lead to embryolethality. 4. the extent of inhibition of dna synthesis provoked by inhibition of mitochondrial protein synthesis depends on a number of factors which include: different growth rates during organogenesis, the number of mitochondria present prior to treatment, availability of extramitochondrial atp sources and placental permeability barrier.",Bass R,1977,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00498685,190546,Bass R; Oerter D,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D000900: Anti-Bacterial Agents; D004272: DNA, Mitochondrial; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D003576: Electron Transport Complex IV; D004622: Embryo, Mammalian; D005260: Female; D005865: Gestational Age; D008928: Mitochondria; D011247: Pregnancy; D014176: Protein Biosynthesis; D051381: Rats; D013839: Thiamphenicol; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W3156560541,48,5,1,1571,265,17

false,long adaptation reveals mostly attractive shifts of orientation tuning in cat primary visual cortex,"in the adult brain, sensory cortical neurons undergo transient changes of their response properties following prolonged exposure to an appropriate stimulus (adaptation). in cat v1, orientation-selective cells shift their preferred orientation after being adapted to a non-preferred orientation. there are conflicting reports as to the direction of those shifts, towards (attractive) or away (repulsive) from the adapter. moreover, the mechanisms underlying attractive shifts remain unexplained. in the present investigation we show that attractive shifts are the most frequent outcome of a 12 min adaptation. overall, cells displaying selectivity for oblique orientations exhibit significantly larger shifts than cells tuned to cardinal orientations. in addition, cells selective to cardinal orientations had larger shift amplitudes when the absolute difference between the original preferred orientation and the adapting orientation increased. conversely, cells tuned to oblique orientations exhibited larger shift amplitudes when this absolute orientation difference was narrower. hence, neurons tuned to oblique contours appear to show more plasticity in response to small perturbations. two different mechanisms appear to produce attractive and repulsive orientation shifts. attractive shifts result from concurrent response depression on the non-adapted flank and selective response facilitation on the adapted flank of the orientation tuning curve. in contrast, repulsive shifts are caused solely by response depression on the adapted flank. we suggest that an early mechanism leads to repulsive shifts while attractive shifts engage a subsequent late facilitation. a potential role for attractive shifts may be improved stimulus discrimination around the adapting orientation.",Ghisovan N,2009,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2009.09.003,19747528,Ghisovan N; Nemri A; Shumikhina S; Molotchnikoff S,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000200: Action Potentials; D000222: Adaptation, Physiological; D000818: Animals; D002415: Cats; D005260: Female; D008297: Male; D009434: Neural Pathways; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009474: Neurons; D009483: Neuropsychological Tests; D009949: Orientation; D010364: Pattern Recognition, Visual; D010775: Photic Stimulation; D011930: Reaction Time; D013997: Time Factors; D014793: Visual Cortex; D014795: Visual Pathways",,,https://openalex.org/W2028070115,99,14,1,1783,270,14

false,memantine alters striatal plasticity inducing a shift of synaptic responses toward long-term depression,"memantine is an open channel blocker that antagonizes nmda receptors reducing the inappropriate calcium (ca2+) influx occurring in presence of moderately increased glutamate levels. at the same time, memantine has the ability to preserve the transient physiological activation of nmda receptor, essential for learning and memory formation at synaptic level. in the present study we investigated the effects exerted by memantine on striatal synaptic plasticity in rat striatal spiny projection neurons (spns). in vitro application of memantine in striatal slices elicited a disruption of long-term potentiation (ltp) induction and maintenance, and revealed, in the majority of the recorded neurons, a long-term depression (ltd), whose amplitude was concentration-dependent (0.3–10 μm). interestingly, preincubation with the dopamine (da) d2 receptor antagonist sulpiride (10 μm) prevented memantine-induced ltd and restored ltp. moreover, the da d2 agonist quinpirole (10 μm), similarly to memantine, induced ltd in a subgroup of spns. in addition, memantine-induced ltd was also prevented by the cb1 endocannabinoid receptor antagonist am 251 (1 μm). these results suggest that the actions exerted by memantine on striatal synaptic plasticity, and in particular the induction of ltd observed in spns, could be attributed to its ability to activate da d2 receptors. by contrast, blockade of nmda receptor is not involved in memantine-induced ltd since apv (30 μm) and mk801 (10 μm), two nmda receptor antagonists, failed to induce this form of synaptic plasticity. our data indicate that memantine could be used as treatment of neurological disorders in which da d2 receptor represents a possible therapeutic target.",Mancini M,2016,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2015.10.015,26471421,Mancini M; Ghiglieri V; Bagetta V; Pendolino V; Vannelli A; Cacace F; Mineo D; Calabresi P; Picconi B,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D001703: Biophysics; D000697: Central Nervous System Stimulants; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D003342: Corpus Striatum; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D008297: Male; D008559: Memantine; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D010852: Picrotoxin; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013569: Synapses; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2196284944,103,13,1,1715,299,10

false,quantifying realized inbreeding in wild and captive animal populations,"most molecular measures of inbreeding do not measure inbreeding at the scale that is most relevant for understanding inbreeding depression—namely the proportion of the genome that is identical-by-descent (ibd). the inbreeding coefficient fped obtained from pedigrees is a valuable estimator of ibd, but pedigrees are not always available, and cannot capture inbreeding loops that reach back in time further than the pedigree. we here propose a molecular approach to quantify the realized proportion of the genome that is ibd (propibd), and we apply this method to a wild and a captive population of zebra finches (taeniopygia guttata). in each of 948 wild and 1057 captive individuals we analyzed available single-nucleotide polymorphism (snp) data (260 snps) spread over four different genomic regions in each population. this allowed us to determine whether any of these four regions was completely homozygous within an individual, which indicates ibd with high confidence. in the highly nomadic wild population, we did not find a single case of ibd, implying that inbreeding must be extremely rare (propibd=0–0.00094, 95% ci). in the captive population, a five-generation pedigree strongly underestimated the average amount of realized inbreeding (fped=0.013<propibd=0.064), as expected given that pedigree founders were already related. we suggest that this snp-based technique is generally useful for quantifying inbreeding at the individual or population level, and we show analytically that it can capture inbreeding loops that reach back up to a few hundred generations.",Knief U,2015,Heredity (Edinb),https://doi.org/10.1038/hdy.2014.116,25585923,Knief U; Hemmrich-Stanisak G; Wittig M; Franke A; Griffith SC; Kempenaers B; Forstmeier W,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D005260: Female; D046369: Finches; D005828: Genetics, Population; D005838: Genotype; D006239: Haplotypes; D007178: Inbreeding; D008297: Male; D008957: Models, Genetic; D010375: Pedigree; D020641: Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; D017422: Sequence Analysis, DNA",,,https://openalex.org/W2034152653,70,9,1,1578,270,8
false,glutathione depletion in the guinea pig and its effect on the acute cochlear toxicity of ethacrynic acid,"there is controversy as to whether or not the acute cochlear toxicity of ethacrynic acid (ea) is dependent upon its metabolic conversion to ea-cysteine via conjugation with glutathione. in order to investigate this we examined the acute effects of ea on cochlear potentials in guinea pigs in which glutathione levels were decreased by prior administration of (+/-)-buthionine sulphoximine (bso), an inhibitor of glutamylcysteine synthetase. first, we determined the effects of bso on hepatic and renal glutathione levels in the guinea pig. guinea pigs (pigmented animals of both sexes or male albino animals) were killed at intervals up to 72 hr after i.p. administration of 1.6 g kg-1 bso. livers, and also kidneys in the case of pigmented guinea pigs, were removed and total glutathione (gsh + gssg) measured. glutathione levels reached a nadir in the liver at 24-48 hr (11% of control) and in the kidneys at 24 hr (14% of control) after administration of bso. hepatic but not renal levels approached control values by 72 hr. there were no sex or strain differences. pigmented guinea pigs were anaesthetised and their endocochlear potential and a.c. cochlear potential in response to a 4 khz tone were measured using an intracochlear microelectrode. the depression of these potentials by i.v. administration of 60 mg kg-1 ea was not affected by administration of 1.6 g kg-1 bso 24 hr earlier, despite profound depletion of glutathione. also prior p.o. administration of n-acetyl-l-cysteine did not affect hepatic glutathione levels nor modify the toxicity of ea. these results suggest that the acute cochlear toxicity of ea is not altered by glutathione depletion, a finding which argues against a role for the metabolic activation of ea in its ototoxicity.",Lazenby CM,1988,Biochem Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(88)90409-1,3178887,Lazenby CM; Lee SJ; Harpur ES; Gescher A,article,D016428: Journal Article,D000818: Animals; D019328: Buthionine Sulfoximine; D003051: Cochlea; D003545: Cysteine; D004976: Ethacrynic Acid; D005260: Female; D005978: Glutathione; D006168: Guinea Pigs; D007668: Kidney; D008099: Liver; D008297: Male; D008717: Methionine Sulfoximine; D013045: Species Specificity,,,https://openalex.org/W2084085760,104,17,1,1759,319,15

false,mechanistic insights into the link between a polymorphism of the 3′utr of theslc7a1gene and hypertension,"we previously identified the polymorphism ss52051869 in the 3'utr of human slc7a1, and demonstrated that it might participate in the apparent link between altered endothelial function, decreased l-arginine and nitric oxide (no) metabolism, and a genetic predisposition to essential hypertension. here, we demonstrate that the major allele contains a consensus sequence for the transcription factor sp1 and binds to sp1, in contrast, the minor allele fails to bind to sp1. resequencing of the entire slc7a1 coding sequence failed to find other informative polymorphisms, indicating that ss52051869 plays a key role in the biochemical and clinical association. in conjunction, the short and long variants of the 3'utr of slc7a1 contain three and four potential microrna-122 (mir-122) binding sites, respectively. we found that the minor allele is more frequently associated with slc7a1 bearing a long 3'utr, while the major allele is more likely to accompany a short 3'utr only (p=0.034). as such, reporter genes containing the long 3'utr from slc7a1 show much less gene expression than those containing short 3'utr from slc7a1, regardless of their allele status (p<0.01), suggesting that an alternative polyadenylation event and/or mirna-122 binding sites may also play a role in controlling gene expression. it is therefore possible that binding of mir-122 to the 3'utr may cause the depression of gene expression, contributing to the lesser level of slc7a1 and the endothelial dysfunction seen in hypertensive subjects. taken together, these data provide novel insights into the mechanism by which ss52051869 influences slc7a1 gene expression.",Yang Z,2009,Hum Mutat,https://doi.org/10.1002/humu.20891,19067360,Yang Z; Kaye DM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D020413: 3' Untranslated Regions; D000483: Alleles; D000818: Animals; D001665: Binding Sites; D016466: CHO Cells; D027201: Cationic Amino Acid Transporter 1; D006224: Cricetinae; D003412: Cricetulus; D024202: Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay; D015870: Gene Expression; D005787: Gene Frequency; D005838: Genotype; D006367: HeLa Cells; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D035683: MicroRNAs; D009841: Oligonucleotides; D011110: Polymorphism, Genetic; D011485: Protein Binding; D020133: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; D016329: Sp1 Transcription Factor",,,https://openalex.org/W2137154808,111,23,1,1644,278,8

false,sperm quality but not relatedness predicts sperm competition success in threespine sticklebacks (gasterosteus aculeatus),"mating between close relatives often leads to a reduction of an individual's fitness, due to an increased expression of deleterious alleles. thus, in many animal taxa pre- as well as postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanisms have evolved. an increased risk of inbreeding and hence a loss of genetic variation may occur during founder events as in most cases only few individuals establish a new population. the threespine stickleback (gasterosteus aculeatus) is a small externally fertilizing fish species subject to strong sperm competition. sticklebacks inhabit both marine and freshwater environments and anadromous populations have repeatedly established new genetically less diverse freshwater populations. previous studies showed that anadromous sticklebacks strongly suffer from inbreeding depression and when given the choice females prefer to mate with unrelated males.the present study aimed to address whether there exists a postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanism solely based on sperm-egg interactions in sperm competition experiments. we used f1 individuals that originated either from a large, genetically heterogeneous anadromous population or from a small, genetically less diverse freshwater population. for each population, eggs of two different females were in vitro fertilized by the same two males' sperm in a paired study design. in the main experiment one male was the female's full-sib brother and in the control experiment all individuals were unrelated. the results revealed that fertilization success was independent of relatedness in both populations suggesting a general lack of a postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance mechanism. instead, male quality (i.e. sperm morphology) predicted paternity success during competitive fertilization trials.in sticklebacks, there is no evidence for postcopulatory inbreeding avoidance. sperm morphology predicted paternity instead, thus sperm quality traits are under strong sexual selection, presumably driven by the high risk of sperm competition under natural conditions.",Mehlis M,2015,BMC Evol Biol,https://doi.org/10.1186/s12862-015-0353-x,25928309,Mehlis M; Rahn AK; Bakker TC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D005260: Female; D005306: Fertilization; D005828: Genetics, Population; D007178: Inbreeding; D008297: Male; D012098: Reproduction; D023701: Smegmamorpha; D013094: Spermatozoa",,,https://openalex.org/W2038316321,120,16,1,2050,311,13
false,transient neutralization of tumor necrosis factor alpha can produce a chronic fungal infection in an immunocompetent host: potential role of immature dendritic cells,"the mechanisms underlying induction of immune dysregulation and chronic fungal infection by a transient tumor necrosis factor alpha (tnf-alpha) deficiency remain to be defined. the objective of our studies was to determine the potential contribution of neutropenia and immature dendritic cells to the immune deviation. administration of an anti-tnf-alpha monoclonal antibody at day 0 neutralized tnf-alpha only during the first week of a pulmonary cryptococcus neoformans infection. transient neutralization of tnf-alpha resulted in transient depression of interleukin-12 (il-12), monocyte chemotactic protein 1 (mcp-1), and gamma interferon (ifn-gamma) production but permanently impaired long-term clearance of the infection from the lungs even after the levels of these cytokines increased and a vigorous inflammatory response developed. early neutrophil recruitment was defective in the absence of tnf-alpha. however, as demonstrated by neutrophil depletion studies, this did not account for the decrease in il-12 and ifn-gamma levels and did not play a role in establishing chronic pulmonary cryptococcal infection. transient tnf-alpha neutralization also produced a deficiency in cd11c(+) mhc ii(+) cells and il-12 in the lymph nodes, potentially implicating a defect in mature dendritic cell trafficking. transfer of cryptococcal antigen-pulsed immature dendritic cells into naive mice prior to intratracheal challenge resulted in the development of a nonprotective immune response to c. neoformans that was similar to that observed in anti-tnf-alpha-treated mice (increased il-4, il-5, and il-10 levels, pulmonary eosinophilia, and decreased clearance). thus, stimulation of an antifungal response by immature dendritic cells can result in an immune deviation similar to that produced by transient tnf-alpha deficiency, identifying a new mechanism by which a chronic fungal infection can occur in an immunocompetent host.",Herring AC,2005,Infect Immun,https://doi.org/10.1128/iai.73.1.39-49.2005,15618139,Herring AC; Falkowski NR; Chen GH; McDonald RA; Toews GB; Huffnagle GB,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D018932: Chemokine CCL2; D002908: Chronic Disease; D003453: Cryptococcosis; D003713: Dendritic Cells; D007121: Immunocompetence; D018664: Interleukin-12; D007962: Leukocytes; D008172: Lung Diseases, Fungal; D051379: Mice; D008808: Mice, Inbred CBA; D009181: Mycoses; D014409: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",,,https://openalex.org/W2130652971,165,24,1,1929,303,9

false,inbreeding depression and male survivorship in drosophila: implications for senescence theory,"abstract the extent to which inbreeding depression affects longevity and patterns of survivorship is an important issue from several research perspectives, including evolutionary biology, conservation biology, and the genetic analysis of quantitative traits. however, few previous inbreeding depression studies have considered longevity as a focal life-history trait. we maintained laboratory populations of drosophila melanogaster at census population sizes of 2 and 10 male-female pairs for up to 66 generations and performed repeated assays of male survivorship throughout this time period. on average, significant levels of inbreeding depression were observed for median life span and age-specific mortality. for age-specific mortality, the severity of inbreeding depression increased over the life span. we found that a baseline inbreeding load of 0.307 lethal equivalents per gamete affected age-specific mortality, and that this value increased at a rate of 0.046 per day of the life span. with respect to some survivorship parameters, the differentiation of lineages was nonlinear with respect to the inbreeding coefficient, which suggested that nonadditive genetic variation contributed to variation among lineages. these findings provide insights into the genetic basis of longevity as a quantitative trait and have implications regarding the mutation-accumulation evolutionary explanation of senescence.",Swindell WR,2006,Genetics,https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.105.045740,16204222,Swindell WR; Bouzat JL,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D005075: Biological Evolution; D016922: Cellular Senescence; D003433: Crosses, Genetic; D004331: Drosophila melanogaster; D005260: Female; D006238: Haploidy; D007178: Inbreeding; D008136: Longevity; D008297: Male; D009154: Mutation; D019655: Quantitative Trait, Heritable; D017741: Survivors",,,https://openalex.org/W2131757606,93,12,1,1414,211,8

true,functional uncoupling nmdar nr2a subunit from psd-95 in the prefrontal cortex: effects on behavioral dysfunction and parvalbumin loss after early-life stress,"exposure to early-life stress increases vulnerability to psychiatric disorders, including depression, schizophrenia, and anxiety. growing evidence implicates aberrant development of the prefrontal cortex (pfc) in the effects of early-life stress, which often emerge in adolescence or young adulthood. specifically, early-life stress in the form of maternal separation (ms) in rodents has been shown to decrease parvalbumin (pvb)-positive interneurons in the adolescent pfc; however, the mechanism underpinning behavioral dysfunction and pvb loss is not yet known. we recently reported that ms causes overexpression of the nmda subunit nr2a in the pfc of adolescent rats. elevated pfc nr2a is also found in developmental models of schizophrenia and is correlated with behavioral deficits, acting largely through its association with the postsynaptic protein psd-95. in addition, adolescent maturation of pvb-positive interneurons relies on nr2a-driven nmda activity. therefore, it is possible that the nr2a/psd-95 signaling complex has a role in adolescent ms effects. here, we aimed to determine whether a discrete manipulation of pfc nr2a could prevent ms effects on pfc-controlled behaviors, including cognition, anxiety, and novelty-induced hyperlocomotion, as well as pvb loss in adolescence. we intracranially infused the nr2a-specific blocking peptide tat2a in order to uncouple nr2a from psd-95 in the early-adolescent pfc, without antagonizing the nmda receptor. we demonstrated that ms rats treated with tat2a during early adolescence were protected from ms-induced pvb loss and exhibited less anxious behavior than those infused with control peptide. these data implicate nr2a-related n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor development in adolescent behavioral and neural consequences of early-life stress.",Ganguly P,2015,Neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1038/npp.2015.134,25953359,Ganguly P; Holland FH; Brenhouse HC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000367: Age Factors; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D000076122: Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein; D005106: Exploratory Behavior; D005260: Female; D005786: Gene Expression Regulation; D047908: Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; D008426: Maternal Deprivation; D018782: Maze Learning; D008565: Membrane Proteins; D001523: Mental Disorders; D010320: Parvalbumins; D010455: Peptides; D017397: Prefrontal Cortex; D011247: Pregnancy; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D021641: Recognition, Psychology; D011993: Recombinant Fusion Proteins; D013315: Stress, Psychological",,,https://openalex.org/W259253011,157,22,1,1807,282,11

true,a new animal model of (chronic) depression induced by repeated and intermittent lipopolysaccharide administration for 4months,"chronic activation of immune-inflammatory and oxidative and nitrosative stress (o&ns) pathways plays an important role in the pathophysiology of clinical depression. increased iga responses directed against lps of gram-negative bacteria, indicating increased bacterial translocation, may be one of the drivers underpinning these pathways. there is a strong association between signs of bacterial translocation and chronicity of depression and o&ns, but not pro-inflammatory cytokines. the aims of the present study were to: (1) develop a new neurobehavioral model of (chronic) depression (anhedonic behavior) that may reflect chronic lps stimulation and is associated with increased oxidative stress, and (2) to delineate the effects of fluoxetine on this new depression model. we established that in female mice repeated lps injections once daily for 5 days (from 750 μg/kg to a maximal dose 1250 μg/kg; increasing doses for the first three days which were then gradually decreased on day 4 and 5) at a one-month interval and this repeated for 4 consecutive months induced chronic anhedonia (estimated by the preference to drink a 1% sucrose) lasting for at least 7 weeks. chronic lps administration significantly decreased thymus weight, proliferative activity of splenocytes, production of interferon (ifn)γ and interleukin-(il)10, and increased superoxide and corticosterone production. treatment with fluoxetine for 3 weeks abolished the neurobehavioral effects of lps. the antidepressant effect of fluoxetine was accompanied by increased production of il-10 and reduced superoxide and corticosterone production. our results suggest that repeated intermittent lps injections to female mice may be a useful model of chronic depression and in particular for the depressogenic effects of long standing activation of the toll-like receptor iv complex.",Kubera M,2013,Brain Behav Immun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2013.01.001,23313516,Kubera M; Curzytek K; Duda W; Leskiewicz M; Basta-Kaim A; Budziszewska B; Roman A; Zajicova A; Holan V; Szczesny E; Lason W; Maes M,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001835: Body Weight; D002755: Choice Behavior; D003863: Depression; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004435: Eating; D005260: Female; D005473: Fluoxetine; D008070: Lipopolysaccharides; D051379: Mice; D013395: Sucrose; D013950: Thymus Gland",,,https://openalex.org/W2061212294,125,18,1,1852,310,9
false,"the compounding effects of high pollen limitation, selfing rates and inbreeding depression leave a new zealand tree with few viable offspring","background and aims interactions between species are especially sensitive to environmental changes. the interaction between plants and pollinators is of particular interest given the potential current global decline in pollinators. reduced pollinator services can be compensated for in some plant species by self-pollination. however, if inbreeding depression is high, selfed progeny could die prior to reaching adulthood, leading to cryptic recruitment failure. methods to examine this scenario, pollinator abundance, pollen limitation, selfing rates and inbreeding depression were examined in 12 populations of varying disturbance levels in sophora microphylla (fabaceae), an endemic new zealand tree species. key results high pollen limitation was found in all populations (average of 58 % reduction in seed production, nine populations), together with high selfing rates (61 % of offspring selfed, six populations) and high inbreeding depression (selfed offspring 86 % less fit, six populations). pollen limitation was associated with lower visitation rates by the two endemic bird pollinators. conclusions the results suggest that for these populations, over half of the seeds produced are genetically doomed. this reduction in the fitness of progeny due to reduced pollinator service is probably important to population dynamics of other new zealand species. more broadly, the results suggest that measures of seed production or seedling densities may be a gross overestimate of the effective offspring production. this could lead to cryptic recruitment failure, i.e. a decline in successful reproduction despite high progeny production. given the global extent of pollinator declines, cryptic recruitment failure may be widespread.",Van Etten ML,2015,Ann Bot,https://doi.org/10.1093/aob/mcv118,26229065,Van Etten ML; Tate JA; Anderson SH; Kelly D; Ladley JJ; Merrett MF; Peterson PG; Robertson AW,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D007178: Inbreeding; D009520: New Zealand; D054817: Pollination; D011157: Population Dynamics; D057945: Self-Fertilization; D029909: Sophora,,,https://openalex.org/W2260864957,141,22,1,1738,282,13

methods: in the first part of present study, the time course of zinc deficient diet induced alterations in the tail suspension test (tst) in mice was investigated. in the second part, the effect of imipramine and escitalopram in control and zinc-deprived for 3 weeks mice was examined in the tst.
results: a4- and 10-week administration of a zn-deficient diet enhanced the immobility time in the tst (by 20% and 57%, respectively). by contrast, a 2-week period of a zinc deficient diet effected the reduction (by 24%) of the immobility time. moreover, a 2- and 4-week (but not 10-week) of a zn-deficient diet resulted in the reduction of the body weight (by 37% and 18%, respectively). these results indicate the developing response to zinc deficiency induced by a zinc-deficient diet. the antidepressant-like effect (reduction in the immobility time) of both drugs was significantly reduced in zinc-deprived mice, which suggests treatment-resistance induced by zinc deprivation.

true,chronic psychosocial stress regulates the expression of both gr and mr mrna in the hippocampal formation of tree shrews,"a persistent hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and thus elevated glucocorticoid levels are main neuroendocrine features of depressive symptomatology in humans. the broad range of effects that are set off by glucocorticoids is mediated by glucocorticoid receptors (grs) and mineralocorticoid receptors (mrs), which themselves are subject to autoregulation. in order to investigate the impact of long-lasting psychological stress on corticosteroid receptor mrna expression in the hippocampal formation, we employed the psychosocial stress paradigm in male tree shrews (tupaia belangeri). by in situ hybridization studies and semiquantitative evaluation of stress-induced changes of gr and mr mrna expression at the single-cell level, brain tissue from subordinate animals which were exposed to 27 days (1 h/day) of social confrontation was compared to that of nonstressed animals. four weeks of stress exposure resulted in a downregulation of gr mrna in the dentate gyrus and hippocampal subfields ca1 and ca3 of subordinate male tree shrews compared to controls. the mr mrna content in these subfields of the anterior hippocampus was also clearly reduced. on the contrary, in a more posterior location on the longitudinal axis of the tree shrew hippocampus, the mr message was increased in subfields ca1 and ca3 and in the dentate gyrus. these results suggest a relevance of the stress-induced regulation of both corticosteroid receptor subtype mrnas in a naturalistic challenging situation. moreover, the differential regulation of mr mrna along the rostrocaudal axis of the hippocampus adds another feature to the heterogenous composition of this structure.",Meyer U,2001,Hippocampus,https://doi.org/10.1002/hipo.1047,11769314,Meyer U; van Kampen M; Isovich E; Flügge G; Fuchs E,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001835: Body Weight; D003863: Depression; D005786: Gene Expression Regulation; D006624: Hippocampus; D006854: Hydrocortisone; D007030: Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; D008297: Male; D010913: Pituitary-Adrenal System; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D011965: Receptors, Glucocorticoid; D018161: Receptors, Mineralocorticoid; D012919: Social Behavior; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D014418: Tupaiidae",,,https://openalex.org/W2106488501,119,19,1,1681,267,9
false,the role of 5-ht1a receptors in mediating acute negative effects of antidepressants: implications in pediatric depression,"acute antidepressant exposure elevates the frequency of impulsive behavior and suicidal thoughts in children and adolescents with major depressive disorder (mdd). long-term antidepressant treatment, however, is beneficial for pediatric mdd, so it is necessary to explore novel treatments that prevent the potentially dangerous consequences of acute antidepressant initiation. in the present study, a treatment strategy designed to reverse the acute negative behavioral effects of antidepressants was tested in rodents. co-administration of the 5-ht1a receptor (5-ht1ar) antagonist way-100635 reversed the negative effects of acute fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, but not reboxetine, a norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, supporting the involvement of 5-ht1ar in mediating the negative consequences of acute selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) treatment. no 5-ht1ar antagonists are currently approved for use in pediatric populations, so alternative strategies should be explored. one such strategy was suggested based on the hypothesis that the rate of 5-ht1ar activation and the subsequent inhibition of serotonergic neuron activity caused by acute ssri administration is proportional to the loading rate of an antidepressant. existing pharmacological data were examined, and significant correlations were observed between the half-life of antidepressants and the rate of suicide-related events (sres). specifically, antidepressants with longer half-lives have lower rates of sres. on the basis of these data, novel dosing strategies were developed for five antidepressants to mimic the pharmacological profile of the antidepressant with the longest half-life, fluoxetine. these dosing strategies could be used to decrease the rate of sres associated with acute antidepressant treatment in pediatric mdd until an improved pharmacological treatment is developed.",Rahn KA,2015,Transl Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2015.57,25942044,Rahn KA; Cao YJ; Hendrix CW; Kaplin AI,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D018759: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001007: Anxiety; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D002648: Child; D003865: Depressive Disorder, Major; D005473: Fluoxetine; D006801: Humans; D051379: Mice; D009025: Morpholines; D010879: Piperazines; D011725: Pyridines; D000077593: Reboxetine; D044282: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A; D058829: Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Antagonists; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D059020: Suicidal Ideation; D013405: Suicide",,,https://openalex.org/W1552252033,121,17,1,1883,284,10

true,sex-specific antidepressant effects of dietary creatine with and without sub-acute fluoxetine in rats,"the potential role of metabolic impairments in the pathophysiology of depression is motivating researchers to evaluate the treatment efficacy of creatine, a naturally occurring energetic and neuroprotective compound found in brain and muscle tissues. growing evidence is demonstrating the benefit of oral creatine supplements for reducing depressive symptoms in humans and animals. a novel question is whether dietary creatine, when combined with antidepressant drug therapy, would be more effective than either compound alone. to answer this question, four studies were conducted to investigate the behavioral effects of combined creatine and low-dose fluoxetine treatment using the forced swim test in male and female rats. sprague–dawley rats were fed powdered rodent chow supplemented with 0%, 2% or 4% w/w creatine monohydrate for 5 weeks. rats were injected with fluoxetine (5.0 or 10.0 mg/kg) or saline according to a sub-acute dosing schedule. female rats maintained on a 4% creatine diet displayed antidepressant-like effects compared to non-supplemented females prior to fluoxetine treatment. in contrast, creatine did not alter behavior reliably in males. following drug treatment and a second forced swim trial, the antidepressant-like profile of creatine remained significant only in females co-administered 5.0 mg/kg fluoxetine. moreover, in females only, supplementation with 4% creatine produced a more robust antidepressant-like behavioral profile compared to either dose of fluoxetine alone. estrous cycle data indicated that ovarian hormones influenced the antidepressant-like effects of creatine. addressing the issue of sex differences in response to treatment may affect our understanding of creatine, its relationship with depressive behavior, and may lead to sex-specific therapeutic strategies.",Allen PJ,2012,Pharmacol Biochem Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pbb.2012.03.005,22429992,Allen PJ; D'Anci KE; Kanarek RB; Renshaw PF,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001921: Brain; D003401: Creatine; D003863: Depression; D019587: Dietary Supplements; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004357: Drug Synergism; D004971: Estrus; D005260: Female; D005473: Fluoxetine; D008297: Male; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D012727: Sex Characteristics",,,https://openalex.org/W2036852450,101,13,1,1819,284,12
false,postembryonic growth of the optic tectum in goldfish. ii. modulation of cell proliferation by retinal fiber input,"the proliferation of cells in the germinal zone of the optic tectum of adult goldfish was studied following unilateral optic nerve crush or removal of one eye. dividing germinal cells were labeled with [3h]thymidine, which was injected at various times (0 to 30 days) following surgery; fish were sacrificed after short (48 hr) survival times. the numbers of labeled nuclei in the tectal germinal zones were compared on the two sides (intact and denervated). we show that permanent removal of optic input (by enucleation) resulted in a sustained depression of [3h]thymidine incorporation in the tectal germinal zone on the denervated compared to the intact side. temporary denervation (by optic nerve crush) initially had a similar effect; however, upon reinnervation of the tectum by regenerating optic fibers, proliferation was enhanced on the experimental side compared to the intact side. because cells in the germinal zone are known to produce new tectal cells, neurons as well as glia, in the normal growing adult brain (raymond, p. a. and s. s. easter, jr. (1983) j. neurosci. 3: 1077-1091), some of the proliferating cells may have been generating neurons. this inference is supported by the observation that in two fish whose right eye had been removed more than 2 years earlier, there were fewer neurons in the denervated tectum than in the intact tectum. thus, it is likely that the observed decrease in incorporation of [3h]thymidine by cells in the germinal zone of the denervated optic tectum resulted in a slower rate of addition of new tectal cells on the affected side. we conclude that cytogenesis in the germinal zone of the growing optic tectum of adult goldfish is regulated by optic fiber input. this mechanism may be important in matching the rates of growth of retina and tectum in the normal brain of the growing adult fish.",Raymond PA,1983,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.03-05-01092.1983,6842283,Raymond PA; Easter SS; Burnham JA; Powers MK,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",D000375: Aging; D000818: Animals; D002455: Cell Division; D006054: Goldfish; D009900: Optic Nerve; D012160: Retina; D013477: Superior Colliculi,,,https://openalex.org/W1501080764,113,19,3,1849,351,11

false,functional roles of cardiac and vascular atp-sensitive potassium channels clarified by kir6.2-knockout mice,"-atp-sensitive potassium (k(atp)) channels were discovered in ventricular cells, but their roles in the heart remain mysterious. k(atp) channels have also been found in numerous other tissues, including vascular smooth muscle. two pore-forming subunits, kir6.1 and kir6.2, contribute to the diversity of k(atp) channels. to determine which subunits are operative in the cardiovascular system and their functional roles, we characterized the effects of pharmacological k(+) channel openers (kcos, ie, pinacidil, p-1075, and diazoxide) in kir6.2-deficient mice. sarcolemmal k(atp) channels could be recorded electrophysiologically in ventricular cells from kir6.2(+/+) (wild-type [wt]) but not from kir6.2(-/-) (knockout [ko]) mice. in wt ventricular cells, pinacidil induced an outward current and action potential shortening, effects that were blocked by glibenclamide, a k(atp) channel blocker. ko ventricular cells exhibited no response to kcos, but gene transfer of kir6.2 into neonatal ventricular cells rescued the electrophysiological response to p-1075. in terms of contractile function, pinacidil decreased force generation in wt but not ko hearts. pinacidil and diazoxide produced concentration-dependent relaxation in both wt and ko aortas precontracted with norepinephrine. in addition, pinacidil induced a glibenclamide-sensitive current of similar magnitude in wt and ko aortic smooth muscle cells and comparable levels of hypotension in anesthetized wt and ko mice. in both wt and ko aortas, only kir6.1 mrna was expressed. these findings indicate that the kir6.2 subunit mediates the depression of cardiac excitability and contractility induced by kcos; in contrast, kir6.2 plays no discernible role in the arterial tree.",Suzuki M,2001,Circ Res,https://doi.org/10.1161/01.res.88.6.570,11282890,Suzuki M; Li RA; Miki T; Uemura H; Sakamoto N; Ohmoto-Sekine Y; Tamagawa M; Ogura T; Seino S; Marbán E; Nakaya H,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000256: Adenoviridae; D000818: Animals; D001011: Aorta; D001794: Blood Pressure; D015152: Blotting, Northern; D003981: Diazoxide; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004594: Electrophysiology; D005822: Genetic Vectors; D005838: Genotype; D005905: Glyburide; D006321: Heart; D006339: Heart Rate; D006352: Heart Ventricles; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D018345: Mice, Knockout; D009131: Muscle, Smooth, Vascular; D009638: Norepinephrine; D020110: Pinacidil; D015221: Potassium Channels; D024661: Potassium Channels, Inwardly Rectifying; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D014162: Transfection; D014661: Vasoconstriction; D014665: Vasodilator Agents; D016276: Ventricular Function",,,https://openalex.org/W2115950268,107,13,1,1736,308,12

false,time-dependent hypoxic ventilatory responses in rats: effects of ketanserin and 5-carboxamidotryptamine,"we hypothesized that the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht) active drugs ketanserin and 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-ct) would modulate time-dependent hypoxic phrenic and hypoglossal responses, including 1) short-term hypoxic response, 2) posthypoxia frequency decline (phfd), and 3) long-term facilitation (ltf) of respiratory motor output. phrenic and hypoglossal nerve activities were recorded in urethan-anesthetized, paralyzed, vagotomized, and artificially ventilated rats pretreated either with ketanserin (5-ht(2a/c) antagonist; 2 mg/kg iv), 5-ct (5-ht(1a/b) agonist; 10 microg/kg iv), or saline (sham). rats were exposed to three 5-min episodes of hypoxia [fractional inspired o(2) (fi(o2)) = 0.11], separated by 5 min of hyperoxia (fi(o2) = 0.5). during hypoxia, ketanserin augmented phrenic but not hypoglossal burst amplitude; 5-ct had no effect. both drugs accentuated phfd. ketanserin blocked phrenic ltf; hypoglossal ltf was not apparent, even in sham-treated rats. 5-ct reversed ltf, resulting in a long-lasting depression of phrenic burst frequency and amplitude without effect on hypoglossal burst amplitude. the data suggest that 1) 5-ht(2a/c) receptor activation modulates the short-term hypoxic phrenic response and phfd and is necessary for ltf; and 2) 5-ct may affect time-dependent hypoxic ventilatory responses by reducing serotonin release via 5-ht(1a/b) autoreceptor activation.",Kinkead R,1999,Am J Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpregu.1999.277.3.r658,10484481,Kinkead R; Mitchell GS,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D000860: Hypoxia; D007650: Ketanserin; D008297: Male; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D011985: Receptors, Serotonin; D015656: Respiratory Mechanics; D012701: Serotonin; D017366: Serotonin Receptor Agonists; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2182617772,103,12,1,1395,256,8
false,impact of persistent cortical activity (up states) on intracortical and thalamocortical synaptic inputs,"the neocortex generates short epochs of persistent activity called up states, which are associated with changes in cellular and network excitability. using somatosensory thalamocortical slices, we studied the impact of persistent cortical activity during spontaneous up states on intrinsic cellular excitability (input resistance) and on excitatory synaptic inputs of cortical cells. at the intrinsic excitability level, we found that the expected decrease in input resistance (high conductance) resulting from synaptic barrages during up states is counteracted by an increase in input resistance due to depolarization per se. the result is a variable but on average relatively small reduction in input resistance during up states. at the synaptic level, up states enhanced a late synaptic component of short-latency thalamocortical field potential responses but suppressed intracortical field potential responses. the thalamocortical enhancement did not reflect an increase in synaptic strength, as determined by measuring the evoked postsynaptic current, but instead an increase in evoked action potential (spike) probability due to depolarization during up states. in contrast, the intracortical suppression was associated with a reduction in synaptic strength, apparently driven by increased presynaptic intracortical activity during up states. in addition, intracortical suppression also reflected a reduction in evoked spike latency caused by depolarization and the abolishment of longer-latency spikes caused by stronger inhibitory drive during up states. in conclusion, depolarization during up states increases the success of excitatory synaptic inputs to reach firing. however, activity-dependent synaptic depression caused by increased presynaptic firing during up states and the enhancement of evoked inhibitory drive caused by depolarization suppress excitatory intracortical synaptic inputs.",Rigas P,2009,J Neurophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00126.2009,19403750,Rigas P; Castro-Alamancos MA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",D000818: Animals; D001703: Biophysics; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D051379: Mice; D009415: Nerve Net; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009434: Neural Pathways; D011930: Reaction Time; D013569: Synapses; D013788: Thalamus,,,https://openalex.org/W2118878723,103,15,1,1905,284,10
true,increased stress reactivity is associated with cognitive deficits and decreased hippocampal brain-derived neurotrophic factor in a mouse model of affective disorders,"cognitive deficits are a common feature of major depression (md), with largely unknown biological underpinnings. in addition to the affective and cognitive symptoms of md, a dysregulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis is commonly observed in these patients. increased plasma glucocorticoid levels are known to render the hippocampus susceptible to neuronal damage. this structure is important for learning and memory, creating a potential link between hpa axis dysregulation and cognitive deficits in depression. in order to further elucidate how altered stress responsiveness may contribute to the etiology of md, three mouse lines with high (hr), intermediate (ir), or low (lr) stress reactivity were generated by selective breeding. the aim of the present study was to investigate whether increased stress reactivity is associated with deficits in hippocampus-dependent memory tests. to this end, we subjected mice from the hr, ir, and lr breeding lines to tests of recognition memory, spatial memory, and depression-like behavior. in addition, measurements of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) in the hippocampus and plasma of these animals were conducted. our results demonstrate that hr mice exhibit hippocampus-dependent memory deficits along with decreased hippocampal, but not plasma, bdnf levels. thus, the stress reactivity mouse lines are a promising animal model of the cognitive deficits in md with the unique feature of a genetic predisposition for an altered hpa axis reactivity, which provides the opportunity to explore the progression of the symptoms of md, predisposing genetic factors as well as new treatment strategies.",Knapman A,2010,J Psychiatr Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jpsychires.2009.11.014,20035953,Knapman A; Heinzmann JM; Hellweg R; Holsboer F; Landgraf R; Touma C,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D019208: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; D003072: Cognition Disorders; D003345: Corticosterone; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D015536: Down-Regulation; D004797: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; D005260: Female; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D018782: Maze Learning; D051379: Mice; D019964: Mood Disorders; D009483: Neuropsychological Tests; D021641: Recognition, Psychology; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D013550: Swimming",,,https://openalex.org/W2144423934,165,21,1,1668,281,10
false,enhanced cardioplegic protection by a fluorocarbon-oxygenated reperfusate: a phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance study,"prolonged global ischemia results in a defect in oxygen extraction during early reperfusion. this study was thus undertaken to assess the effects of maintaining cardioplegia at the onset of reoxygenation in view of channeling available energy toward reparative cell processes rather than mechanical activity. twenty-four isolated perfused rat hearts were subjected to 120 min of 15°c ischemia. group i (control) was reperfused with the standard krebs perfusion medium whereas in groups ii and iii the initial reperfusate consisted of an oxygenated alkaline cardioplegic solution prior to the resumption of krebs perfusion. oxygenation of the cardioplegic reperfusate was ensured by fluorocarbons at a concentration of 10% (o2 content: 5.5 vol %; group ii) or 20% (o2 content: 9 vol %; group iii). in addition to hemodynamical determinations, high-energy phosphates and intracellular ph were monitored serially by phosphorus-31 nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. after 30 min of reperfusion postischemic recovery of aortic flow was better in group ii (74.0 ± 5.9% of control) than in group i (59.1 ± 5.4% of control, p < 0.05). this functional improvement correlated with a higher postischemic increase in phosphocreatine levels (103.21 ± 11.21% vs 74.12 ± 3.59%, at 3 min of reperfusion, p < 0.05) without significant differences in total atp content. group iii hearts exhibited a slow recovery as evidenced by a severe depression in aortic flow, coronary arteriovenous difference, and total phosphate content during the 15 initial minutes of reperfusion. these results show that the protection provided by cardioplegia can be improved by a fluorocarbon-oxygenated cardioplegic reperfusate. the observation that the 10% fluorocarbon solution yielded a better recovery than the 20% solution tends to support the concept of an optimal amount of oxygen to be delivered during the early postischemic period to help minimizing reperfusion injury.",Bernard M,1985,J Surg Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/0022-4804(85)90145-3,4033105,Bernard M; Menasche P; Canioni P; Grousset C; Fontanarava E; Geyer RP; Piwnica A; Cozzone PJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000818: Animals; D006348: Cardiac Surgical Procedures; D003326: Coronary Circulation; D004734: Energy Metabolism; D005466: Fluorocarbons; D006863: Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; D009682: Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy; D008297: Male; D009206: Myocardium; D010477: Perfusion; D010710: Phosphates; D010725: Phosphocreatine; D051381: Rats,,,https://openalex.org/W2007046088,123,14,1,1947,333,11

false,behaviorally augmented versus other components in organophosphate tolerance: the role of reinforcement and response factors*1,"male wistar-derived rats were used to assess the behaviorally augmented component of tolerance to paraoxon depression of a feeding response. separate groups of animals were treated daily by 0.125 mg/kg of the compound given sc either 1 hr before the start or 45 min after the end of a 90-min feeding session. however, the dose was reduced to 0.0625 mg/kg from day 9 to day 12 of the treatment series if animals showed too severe a reduction in food consumption. after development of tolerance by the presession treatment group, the animals treated after feeding were shifted to treatment before feeding. this shift produced a marked depression in food consumption. this confirms similar data previously obtained by a different test (two-way avoidance), and indicates that behaviorally augmented tolerance to paraoxon related to practice factors may be a fairly general phenomenon. other experiments were to assess the effects of paraoxon in the conditioned taste aversion (cta) paradigm. these showed the development of an aversion only at high dosage levels (two pairings between the flavor cue and 0.25 mg/kg sc, or four pairings with a 0.17-mg/kg dose). however, the failure of lower doses to produce cta may have depended on the relatively slow onset of the intoxication, producing an extended interval between the end of cue exposure and the development of malaise or illness. two pretreatments given 6 and 3 days before the first conditioning session in an experiment using the 2 x 0.25-mg/kg schedule did not affect the development of cta as measured by a conventional double-bottle test. however, a typical interference effect produced by prior exposure was shown by a substantial acceleration of subsequent cta extinction in pretreated animals.",Bignami G,1985,Fundam Appl Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0272-0590(85)90131-9,4092889,Bignami G; Giardini V; Scorrano M,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001362: Avoidance Learning; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001835: Body Weight; D004361: Drug Tolerance; D008297: Male; D009943: Organophosphorus Compounds; D010261: Paraoxon; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains; D012054: Reinforcement, Psychology; D013649: Taste; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2069270816,125,18,1,1753,302,11

false,commentary on the hypermetabolic state and the role of oxygen in alcohol-induced liver injury,"centrilobular hypoxia has been postulated as a mechanism for the development of hepatocellular necrosis and fibrosis in alcoholic liver disease. chronic ethanol ingestion in rodents results in increased hepatic oxygen consumption and in a steeper fall in oxygen tension between the periportal and the pericentral area of the lobule, rendering the pericentral area susceptible to hypoxia. hepatocellular necrosis occurs when ethanol-fed animals are exposed to low atmospheric oxygen. in man, the existence of a hypermetabolic state is more tenuous, but suggested by an increased rate of ethanol elimination after chronic ethanol consumption that has been linked to increased oxygen consumption in animals. also, decreases in hepatic blood flow and hepatic vein oxygen tension were found in alcoholics with histological evidence of liver-cell necrosis as compared to those without necrosis. it is postulated that in man, reduction in the availability of oxygen to the liver may be caused by miscellaneous conditions such as anemia, respiratory depression or infection, cigarette-smoking, or reduction of hepatic blood flow, but the contribution of one or more of these factors remains to be proven. trials of the effect of propylthiouracil (ptu) on alcoholic hepatitis are based on the effect of this drug in decreasing the ethanol-induced hypermetabolic state and in preventing hepatocellular necrosis in animals exposed to low atmospheric oxygen. a tentative conclusion of the two small trials that have been completed is that ptu may be beneficial in moderately ill patients with a low mortality, but not useful in severely ill patients with a high mortality.",Mezey E,1984,Recent Dev Alcohol,https://doi.org/10.1007/978-1-4684-4661-6_8,6374779,Mezey E,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000426: Alcohol Dehydrogenase; D000429: Alcohol Oxidoreductases; D000818: Animals; D004734: Energy Metabolism; D006519: Hepatitis, Alcoholic; D006801: Humans; D008099: Liver; D008102: Liver Circulation; D008104: Liver Cirrhosis, Alcoholic; D008108: Liver Diseases, Alcoholic; D009243: NAD; D010101: Oxygen Consumption; D011441: Propylthiouracil; D051381: Rats; D013963: Thyroid Hormones",,,https://openalex.org/W958410617,93,14,1,1660,271,8

false,chronic fluoxetine inhibits sexual behavior in the male rat: reversal with oxytocin,"rationale: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, used widely in the treatment of depression, progressively inhibit sexual orgasm in many patients and induce a transient inhibition of sexual desire.
objectives: we attempted to model the effects of these drugs in sexually experienced male rats during tests of copulation in bilevel chambers. these chambers allow the study of both appetitive and consummatory sexual responses of male rats.
methods: males were treated daily with fluoxetine hydrochloride (0, 1, 5, or 10 mg/kg) and tested for sexual behavior with receptive females at 4-day intervals. rats were treated with oxytocin (200 ng/kg) or saline after ejaculations had decreased.
results: fluoxetine decreased ejaculatory responses of male rats in a dose- and time-dependent fashion, but left the copulatory efficiency of the males intact. in contrast, conditioned level changing, a measure of appetitive sexual excitement, was inhibited following acute and chronic treatment with 10 mg/kg, although tolerance may have developed to the effect of 5 mg/kg. subsequent administration of oxytocin restored the ejaculatory response but not the measure of sexual excitement to baseline levels.
conclusions: the reversal by oxytocin of the fluoxetine-induced deficit in ejaculations is consistent with the hypothesis that serotonin suppresses ejaculatory mechanisms by interrupting the action of oxytocin, which normally accompanies sexual behavior. co-administration of oxytocin may help to alleviate the predominant sexual side effect of serotonin reuptake blockers.",Cantor JM,1999,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s002130051018,10435408,Cantor JM; Binik YM; Pfaus JG,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001835: Body Weight; D004542: Ejaculation; D005473: Fluoxetine; D008297: Male; D010121: Oxytocin; D051381: Rats; D020318: Rats, Long-Evans; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D012726: Sexual Behavior, Animal",,,https://openalex.org/W2103950239,83,13,1,1576,253,10
true,shaping brain development: mouse communal nesting blunts adult neuroendocrine and behavioral response to social stress and modifies chronic antidepressant treatment outcome,"early experiences shape brain function and behavior and, consequently, vulnerability to psychopathology at adulthood. here we exploited the mouse communal nest (cn) paradigm in order to investigate the effect of the early social environment on the emergence of endophenotypes of depression and on antidepressant efficacy at adulthood. cn, which consists in a single nest where three mothers keep their pups together and share care-giving behavior until weaning, is characterized by high levels of maternal behavior and peer interactions, thus representing an highly stimulating environment. our results show that, when compared to mice reared in standard laboratory conditions (sn), adult cn mice exhibited greater sucrose preference on the first days of the test, displayed reduced anhedonia during social stress and had lower corticosterone levels after acute and prolonged social stress. furthermore, in line with previous work, cn displayed longer immobility than sn mice in the forced swim test. here we show that such behavioral response is differently affected by antidepressants according to early experiences. a 3-week fluoxetine treatment affected only sn mice, leading to an increase of immobility duration up to the levels showed by cn mice, while acute fluoxetine administration decreased immobility duration in both groups. these results show that being reared in a cn profoundly changes developmental trajectories, reducing the adult display of endophenotypes of depression and modifying response to antidepressants. the present findings suggest that early experiences represent one of those factors to be taken into account to identify the appropriate individual pharmacological strategy to treat depression in patients.",Branchi I,2010,Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2009.10.016,19945226,Branchi I; D'Andrea I; Cirulli F; Lipp HP; Alleva E,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001921: Brain; D003345: Corticosterone; D003863: Depression; D004334: Drug Administration Schedule; D005260: Female; D005473: Fluoxetine; D005518: Food Preferences; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008813: Mice, Inbred ICR; D009425: Nesting Behavior; D012931: Social Environment; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D013550: Swimming",,,https://openalex.org/W2043453605,172,22,1,1736,277,9
false,impact of exposure to bacteria on metabolism in the penaeid shrimplitopenaeus vannamei,"we hypothesized that aggregation of bacteria and hemocytes at the gill, which occurs as part of the shrimp’s antibacterial immune defenses, would impair normal respiratory function and thereby disrupt aerobic metabolism. changes in oxygen uptake and lactate accumulation were determined in litopenaeus vannamei, the pacific white shrimp, following injection with either saline (control) or a strain of the gram-negative bacterium vibrio campbellii that is pathogenic in crustaceans. the rate of oxygen uptake was determined during the first 4 h after injection and after 24 h. injection of bacteria decreased oxygen uptake by 27% (from 11.0 to 8.2 μmol g−1 h−1) after 4 h, while saline-injected shrimp showed no change. decreased oxygen uptake persisted 24 h after vibrio injection. in well-aerated water, resting whole-animal lactic acid levels increased in shrimp injected with bacteria (mean = 2.59 μmol lactate g−1 ±0.39 sem, n = 8) compared to saline-injected control shrimp, but this difference did not persist at 24 h. exposure to hypercapnic hypoxia (pco2 = 1.8 kpa, po2 = 6.7 kpa) also resulted in significant whole-body lactic acid differences (mean = 3.99 and 1.8 μmol g−1 tissue in vibrio and saline-injected shrimp, respectively). our results support the hypothesis that the crustacean immune response against invading bacteria impairs normal metabolic function, resulting in depression of oxygen uptake and slightly increased anaerobic metabolism.",Scholnick DA,2006,Biol Bull,https://doi.org/10.2307/4134576,16946240,Scholnick DA; Burnett KG; Burnett LE,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",D000818: Animals; D002245: Carbon Dioxide; D019344: Lactic Acid; D010100: Oxygen; D033561: Penaeidae; D013997: Time Factors; D014733: Vibrio; D014867: Water,,,https://openalex.org/W2163941109,93,19,1,1461,249,6

false,effects of sleep deprivation on serotonergic neuronal activity in the dorsal raphe nucleus of the freely moving cat,"total sleep deprivation (tsd) for one or more nights produces a rapid antidepressant response in humans. since most pharmacological treatments for depression increase brain serotonin neurotransmission, the purpose of the present study was to determine whether tsd increases the activity of serotonergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn) in cats. cats were prevented from sleeping by the experimenter, who monitored the behavioral state of each animal on a polygraph. firing rates during quiet waking (qw) and active waking (aw) were obtained throughout a 24-h sleep deprivation period and subsequent 6-h recovery period. during the experiments, unit activity was also recorded during exposure to loud white noise, which elicited strong behavioral arousal. the inhibitory response of serotonergic drn neurons to systemic administration of the selective 5-ht1a agonist 8-hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin (8-oh-dpat) was determined before and after tsd to assess possible changes in 5-ht1a autoreceptor sensitivity. tsd increased mean firing rates by as much as 18% during both aw and white noise exposure. maximal effects were observed after 15 h of tsd for aw, and after 18 h for white noise. qw firing rates also tended to be elevated throughout tsd. firing rates for all conditions during the recovery period were not significantly different from baseline. the neuronal inhibition produced by 8-oh-dpat was significantly diminished after tsd. overall, these results indicate that tsd increases the firing rate of serotonergic drn neurons during aw and arousal. this effect may be attributable to a decrease in the sensitivity of 5-ht1a autoreceptors. these findings are consistent with the hypothesis that tsd exerts its antidepressant action, at least in part, through an activation of brain serotonergic neurons.",Gardner JP,1997,Neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0893-133x(97)00025-0,9252982,Gardner JP; Fornal CA; Jacobs BL,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D017371: 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin; D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002415: Cats; D008297: Male; D009474: Neurons; D011903: Raphe Nuclei; D011985: Receptors, Serotonin; D017366: Serotonin Receptor Agonists; D012892: Sleep Deprivation",,,https://openalex.org/W2079236941,115,18,1,1827,307,14

false,intensification of the central serotoninergic processes as a possible determinant of the thymoleptic effect,"psychic depression may result from deficiency of brain serotonin. it is suggested that in depression the production of tryptophane pyrrolase by the liver is stimulated by raised blood-corticosteroid levels. as a result the metabolism of tryptophane is shunted away from serotonin production, and towards kynurenine production. blood-corticosteroid levels are raised in depression as a consequence of excitement of the amygdaloid complex, on which serotonin is normally an inhibitory influence. thus, whatever the order of events, a vicious circle is set up. it is suggested that the actions of the various antidepressant treatments in use have a common mechanism—namely, the intensification of the central serotoninergic processes. the thymoleptic action of imipramine-like tricyclic antidepressants results from potentiation of serotoninergic effects on the brain; these effects include inhibition of the amygdala, which suppresses central mechanisms of stress normally manifested in anxiety, tension, and fear. the mood-elevating component of the antidepressant actions of monoamine-oxidase inhibitors and of electroconvulsive therapy is related to the increase in brain serotonin levels. activation of central adrenergic mechanisms is responsible for psychoenergetic and motor-stimulating effects of antidepressants, but not for their mood-elevating actions.",Lapin IP,1969,Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(69)91140-4,4178247,Lapin IP; Oxenkrug GF,article,D016428: Journal Article,D000305: Adrenal Cortex Hormones; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001921: Brain; D001923: Brain Chemistry; D003863: Depression; D004357: Drug Synergism; D004597: Electroshock; D006801: Humans; D007099: Imipramine; D007737: Kynurenine; D008099: Liver; D008996: Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors; D012701: Serotonin; D012702: Serotonin Antagonists; D014149: Tranquilizing Agents; D014364: Tryptophan; D014366: Tryptophan Oxygenase,,,https://openalex.org/W2144886680,107,14,1,1361,203,9

false,regulation of plasticity of glutamate synapses by endocannabinoids and the cyclic‐amp/protein kinase a pathway in midbrain dopamine neurons,"endocannabinoids (ecbs) are lipid signalling molecules which play a key role in the regulation of synaptic transmission and plasticity in the central nervous system. previous studies have reported that ecbs are released ‘on demand’ in the ventral tegmental area (vta), a brain region critical for reward learning. however, their role in modulating the long‐term plasticity of glutamate synapses of vta dopamine (da) neurons remains unknown. in the present study, we showed that low frequency afferent stimulation paired with moderate postsynaptic depolarization elicited an n ‐methyl‐ d ‐aspartate (nmda) receptor‐independent long‐term depression (ltd) at glutamate synapses of vta da neurons. this form of ltd was caused by a decrease in the probability of glutamate release. examination of the mechanisms underlying this form of ltd revealed that it was mediated by retrograde ecb signalling. in addition, we found that inhibition of 2‐arachidonoyl glycerol biosynthesis blocked ltd induction, suggesting that 2‐arachidonoyl glycerol is the most likely retrograde ecb messenger mediating ltd. the ecb‐ltd induced at glutamate synapses of vta da neurons also required the inhibition of the presynaptic camp/pka pathway. taken together, these results reveal a critical role of ecbs in controlling the long‐term plasticity of glutamate synapses in vta da neurons.",Haj-Dahmane S,2010,J Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.2010.190066,20498231,Haj-Dahmane S; Shen RY,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000818: Animals; D001095: Arachidonic Acids; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D020746: Calcium Channels, L-Type; D063385: Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators; D000242: Cyclic AMP; D017868: Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; D004298: Dopamine; D063388: Endocannabinoids; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D005989: Glycerides; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008297: Male; D008636: Mesencephalon; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009474: Neurons; D009543: Nifedipine; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D043884: Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D010738: Type C Phospholipases; D017557: Ventral Tegmental Area",,,https://openalex.org/W1506652958,139,18,1,1362,226,9
false,"efficiency of selection, as measured by single nucleotide polymorphism variation, is dependent on inbreeding rate in drosophila melanogaster","abstract it is often hypothesized that slow inbreeding causes less inbreeding depression than fast inbreeding at the same absolute level of inbreeding. possible explanations for this phenomenon include the more efficient purging of deleterious alleles and more efficient selection for heterozygote individuals during slow, when compared with fast, inbreeding. we studied the impact of inbreeding rate on the loss of heterozygosity and on morphological traits in drosophila melanogaster . we analysed five noninbred control lines, 10 fast inbred lines and 10 slow inbred lines; the inbred lines all had an expected inbreeding coefficient of approximately 0.25. forty single nucleotide polymorphisms in dna coding regions were genotyped, and we measured the size and shape of wings and counted the number of sternopleural bristles on the genotyped individuals. we found a significantly higher level of genetic variation in the slow inbred lines than in the fast inbred lines. this higher genetic variation was resulting from a large contribution from a few loci and a smaller effect from several loci. we attributed the increased heterozygosity in the slow inbred lines to the favouring of heterozygous individuals over homozygous individuals by natural selection, either by associative over‐dominance or balancing selection, or a combination of both. furthermore, we found a significant polynomial correlation between genetic variance and wing size and shape in the fast inbred lines. this was caused by a greater number of homozygous individuals among the fast inbred lines with small, narrow wings, which indicated inbreeding depression. our results demonstrated that the same amount of inbreeding can have different effects on genetic variance depending on the inbreeding rate, with slow inbreeding leading to higher genetic variance than fast inbreeding. these results increase our understanding of the genetic basis of the common observation that slow inbred lines express less inbreeding depression than fast inbred lines. in addition, this has more general implications for the importance of selection in maintaining genetic variation.",Demontis D,2009,Mol Ecol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-294x.2009.04366.x,19780974,Demontis D; Pertoldi C; Loeschcke V; Mikkelsen K; Axelsson T; Kristensen TN,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D004331: Drosophila melanogaster; D019143: Evolution, Molecular; D005260: Female; D017344: Genes, Insect; D056426: Genetic Loci; D005828: Genetics, Population; D005838: Genotype; D007178: Inbreeding; D015810: Linkage Disequilibrium; D019656: Loss of Heterozygosity; D020641: Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; D012641: Selection, Genetic",,,https://openalex.org/W2020320713,147,26,1,2141,341,13
false,inactivation of potassium current in squid axon by a variety of quaternary ammonium ions.,"the characteristics of potassium channel block by a diverse group of quaternary ammonium (qa) ions was examined in squid axons. altering the size and nature of the head and/or tail groups of the qa ions applied internally produced only quantitative differences in the potassium current block. although their entry rate is diminished, compounds with head groups as large as 11 x 12 a are capable of occluding the channel, whereas the smallest qa ions, with head groups approximately 5 x 6 a, are not potent blockers. when one or three terminal hydrogens of the head group were replaced by hydroxyl moieties, the compound's blocking ability was diminished, suggesting that qa binding is not improved by hydrogen bonding at these positions. qa ions bound to their site within the potassium channel with 1:1 stoichiometry, and the site is perhaps 20% or more of the distance through the membrane electric field. raising external potassium concentration did not alter the steady-state or kinetic features of the qa block of outward potassium currents; however, increasing temperature or adding ba2+ internally increased the rate of decay of the qa-blocked currents. from the structure-function analysis of the qa ions, projections concerning both the architecture of the potassium channel's inner mouth and the significance of various chemical constituents of the ions were made. the potassium channel may now be pictured as having a wider mouth (up to 11 x 12 a) extending to the qa binding site and then narrowing quickly to the region of channel selectivity. important alterations that improve the blocking ability of the compounds include: (a) lengthening the alkyl hydrocarbon tail group (up to 10 carbon), (b) lengthening a second hydrocarbon chain of the head group (e.g., decyldimethylphenylammonium bromide [c10dm phi]), and (c) adding a carbonyl moiety to the tail (e.g., ambutonium).",Swenson RP,1981,J Gen Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1085/jgp.77.3.255,6265591,Swenson RP,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001369: Axons; D001693: Biological Transport, Active; D049832: Decapodiformes; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007473: Ion Channels; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D011188: Potassium; D000644: Quaternary Ammonium Compounds",,,https://openalex.org/W2118212061,89,15,1,1889,343,9

false,molecular mechanisms of lymphocyte extravasation. iii. the loss of lymphocyte extravasation potential induced by pertussis toxin is not mediated via the activation of protein kinase c.,"the present study evaluated whether protein kinase c (pkc) activation was involved in the lymphocytosis promoting properties of pertussis toxin (ptx). the exposure of mouse lymphocytes to phorbol esters (as a means to selectively activate pkc) caused a depression in their subsequent capacity to localize into lymph nodes and peyer's patches in vivo. this pattern of inhibition was quite similar to that observed with lymphocytes treated with ptx. the mechanisms responsible for the observed decreases in localization to lymphoid organs caused by these two agents, however, appeared to be distinct. exposure of lymphocytes to pma was followed by a time and dosage-dependent decrease in the surface density of mel-14 defined homing receptors. ptx-treated lymphocytes retained normal density of this homing receptor. consequently, pma-treated lymphocytes lost their capacity to bind to high-endothelial venules in in vitro lymph node binding assays while ptx-treated cells retained normal high-endothelial venule binding potential. we conclude from this study that: 1) the activation of pkc in lymphocytes by pma can alter their recirculation properties via mechanisms that diminish their expression of surface receptors which support extravasation into lymph node and mucosal lymphoid tissues, and 2) even though ptx has been reported to elevate the rate of inositol phosphate turnover in lymphocytes, the loss of extravasation potential of ptx-treated lymphocytes is not mediated via the modification of surface homing receptors as observed in cells exposed to the known pkc activator, pma.",Huang K,1989,J Immunol,https://doi.org/10.4049/jimmunol.143.1.229,2732469,Huang K; Im SY; Samlowski WE; Daynes RA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D019307: 1-(5-Isoquinolinesulfonyl)-2-Methylpiperazine; D000818: Animals; D000954: Antigens, Surface; D002448: Cell Adhesion; D015815: Cell Adhesion Molecules; D002465: Cell Movement; D003877: Dermatitis, Contact; D004139: Dinitrofluorobenzene; D004729: Endothelium, Lymphatic; D004789: Enzyme Activation; D007116: Immunization, Passive; D007422: Intestines; D007546: Isoquinolines; D008198: Lymph Nodes; D008214: Lymphocytes; D051379: Mice; D008809: Mice, Inbred C3H; D037342: Pertussis Toxin; D010879: Piperazines; D011493: Protein Kinase C; D013755: Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate; D010566: Virulence Factors, Bordetella",,,https://openalex.org/W1562893736,184,29,3,1590,258,8
false,developmental inhibitory gate controls the relay of activity to the superficial layers of the visual cortex,"a developmental reduction in the radial transmission of synaptic activity has been proposed to underlie the end of the critical period for experience-dependent modification in layers ii/iii of the visual cortex. using paired-pulse stimulation, we investigated in visual cortical slices how the propagation of synaptic activity to the superficial layers changes during development and how this process is affected by sensory experience. the results can be summarized as follows. (1) layers ii/iii responses to repetitive stimulation of the white matter become increasingly depressed between the third and sixth week of postnatal development, a time course that parallels the end of the critical period. (2) paired-pulse depression is reduced after dark rearing and also by blocking inhibitory synaptic transmission. (3) paired-pulse depression and its regulation by age and sensory experience is more pronounced when stimulation is applied to the white matter than when applied to layer iv. together, these results are consistent with the idea that the maturation of intracortical inhibition reduces the capability of the cortex to relay incoming high-frequency patterns of activity to the supragranular layers.",Rozas C,2001,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.21-17-06791.2001,11517267,Rozas C; Frank H; Heynen AJ; Morales B; Bear MF; Kirkwood A,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000375: Aging; D000818: Animals; D001369: Axons; D003423: Critical Period, Psychological; D003624: Darkness; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018756: GABA Antagonists; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007736: Kynurenic Acid; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D008839: Microelectrodes; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D051381: Rats; D020318: Rats, Long-Evans; D015203: Reproducibility of Results; D012683: Sensory Deprivation; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D014793: Visual Cortex; D014795: Visual Pathways",,,https://openalex.org/W2122113735,107,16,1,1210,193,7

false,opioid-induced long-term potentiation in the spinal cord is a presynaptic event,"opioids remain the mainstay of treatment for severe pain, but the associated hyperalgesia and tolerance are significant impediments to achieving adequate pain relief with opioids. here we show that in the spinal cord, brief application of the mu-opioid receptor agonist (d-ala(2),n-me-phe(4),gly-ol(5))-enkephalin (damgo) at 1 mum, but not at 1-10 nm, caused an initial decrease followed by a large and long-lasting increase in the amplitude of monosynaptic epscs evoked from the dorsal root in approximately 50% of lamina i and ii neurons. however, postsynaptic dialysis of the g-protein inhibitor had no effect on damgo-induced initial inhibition and long-term potentiation (ltp) in either lamina i or ii neurons. damgo-induced ltp was associated with an increase in the paired-pulse depression ratio. furthermore, damgo application and washout induced an initial decrease followed by a persistent increase in the frequency of miniature epscs. bath application, but not postsynaptic dialysis, of an nmda receptor antagonist or a calcium chelator abolished damgo-induced ltp. strikingly, ablation of trpv1-expressing primary afferents not only eliminated damgo-induced ltp but also prolonged damgo-induced inhibition of the miniature and evoked epscs (i.e., long-term depression). thus, our study strongly suggests that trpv1-expressing primary afferents play a prominent role in opioid-induced presynaptic ltp, which challenges a previous report suggesting the postsynaptic nature of this opioid-induced ltp. this excitatory effect of opioids on primary afferents can counteract the inhibitory effect of opioids on synaptic transmission at the spinal level and is likely involved in opioid-induced hyperalgesia and tolerance.",Zhou HY,2010,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.5857-09.2010,20335482,Zhou HY; Chen SR; Chen H; Pan HL,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000701: Analgesics, Opioid; D000818: Animals; D001703: Biophysics; D002118: Calcium; D002614: Chelating Agents; D004224: Diterpenes; D016291: Dizocilpine Maleate; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004533: Egtazic Acid; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D020875: Enkephalin, Ala(2)-MePhe(4)-Gly(5)-; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D006153: Guanosine Diphosphate; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D037102: Lectins; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D008297: Male; D009474: Neurons; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D017729: Presynaptic Terminals; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013116: Spinal Cord; D050916: TRPV Cation Channels; D013873: Thionucleotides; D014633: Valine",,,https://openalex.org/W2075563488,79,11,1,1727,286,9

false,response of upper airway and chest wall muscles to selective brain stem hypoxia in the newborn,"in animals with intact peripheral chemosensory afferents, hypoxia differentially affects upper airway (ua) and chest wall muscles. to determine the contribution of brain stem (bs) hypoxia to the response of ua and chest wall muscles during early life, we perfused the bs through a vertebral artery intermittently with blood from an extracorporeal circuit in nine newborn piglets (age 1–5 days). bs perfusions were performed with hypoxemic blood (arterial po2 32 +/- 6 to 38 +/- 8 torr) with different levels of bs pco2 (28 +/- 2, 37 +/- 4, and 56 +/- 5 torr) while systemic normocapnic hyperoxia was maintained (arterial pco2 36 +/- 3 to 40 +/- 6 torr, arterial po2 345 +/- 73 to 392 +/- 37 torr). electromyograms (emgs) of alae nasi (an), external intercostal (ei), and diaphragm (dia) were recorded. normocapnic hypoxia of the bs induced a sustained increase in an emg (p < 0.01, analysis of variance) and depression of ei and dia emgs without a transient increase. these contrasting responses were also observed during hypocapnic and hypercapnic hypoxia of the bs and were not affected by inputs from the peripheral chemoreceptors or rostral cerebral structures that were not exposed to hypoxia. we conclude that, despite eliciting the known central respiratory depression, bs hypoxia causes an increase in the respiratory drive to an ua airway muscle. thus, bs hypoxia elicits a selective rather than a generalized respiratory muscle depression. the respiratory muscles with high energy expenditure (dia and ei) are depressed while ua muscles are stimulated or disinhibited. this response is independent of the level of bs arterial pco2.",Cattarossi L,1993,J Appl Physiol (1985),https://doi.org/10.1152/jappl.1993.74.5.2443,8335579,Cattarossi L; Haxhiu-Poskurica B; Haxhiu MA; Carlo WA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D001784: Blood Gas Analysis; D001933: Brain Stem; D002245: Carbon Dioxide; D003714: Denervation; D004576: Electromyography; D005112: Extracorporeal Circulation; D006863: Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; D002534: Hypoxia, Brain; D012132: Respiratory Muscles; D012137: Respiratory System; D013552: Swine; D013909: Thorax",,,https://openalex.org/W1845754106,94,16,1,1644,311,10
false,reactive oxygen species potentiate the negative inotropic effect of cardiac m 2 -muscarinic receptor stimulation,"the aim of the present study was to investigate the influence of reactive oxygen species (ros) on the contractile responses of rat isolated left atria to muscarinic receptor stimulation. ros were generated by means of electrolysis (30 ma, 75 s) of the organ bath fluid. twenty minutes after the electrolysis period, the electrically paced atria (3 hz) were stimulated with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin (1 microm). subsequently, cumulative acetylcholine concentration-response curves were constructed (0.01 nm-10 microm). in addition, phosphoinositide turnover and adenylyl cyclase activity under basal and stimulated conditions were measured. for these biochemical experiments we used the stable acetylcholine analogue carbachol. the atria exposed to reactive oxygen species were influenced more potently (pd2 control: 6.2 vs. 7.1 for electrolysis-treated atria, p<0.05) and more effectively (emax control: 40% vs. 90% reduction of the initial amplitude, p<0.05) by acetylcholine. in contrast, ros exposure did not alter the responses to adenosine, whose receptor is also coupled via a gi-protein to adenylyl cyclase. the basal (40% vs. control, p<0.05) as well as the carbachol-stimulated (-85% vs. control, p<0.05) inositol-phosphate formation was reduced in atria exposed to ros. the forskolin-stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity was identical in both groups but carbachol stimulation induced a more pronounced reduction in adenylyl cyclase activity in the electrolysis-treated atria. accordingly we may conclude that ros enhance the negative inotropic response of isolated rat atria to acetylcholine by both a reduction of the positive (inositide turnover) and increase of the negative (adenylyl cyclase inhibition) inotropic components of cardiac muscarinic receptor stimulation. this phenomenon is most likely m2-receptor specific, since the negative inotropic response to adenosine is unaltered by ros exposure.",Peters SL,2001,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s002100100442,11534856,Peters SL; Sand C; Batinik HD; Pfaffendorf M; van Zwieten PA,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004357: Drug Synergism; D004572: Electrolysis; D006325: Heart Atria; D008297: Male; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D009206: Myocardium; D009924: Organ Culture Techniques; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D017382: Reactive Oxygen Species; D043585: Receptor, Muscarinic M2; D011976: Receptors, Muscarinic; D015398: Signal Transduction; D014662: Vasoconstrictor Agents; D014665: Vasodilator Agents",,,https://openalex.org/W2113357323,112,15,1,1931,330,12
true,bidirectional homeostatic regulation of a depression-related brain state by gamma-aminobutyric acidergic deficits and ketamine treatment,"major depressive disorder is increasingly recognized to involve functional deficits in both gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba)ergic and glutamatergic synaptic transmission. to elucidate the relationship between these phenotypes, we used gabaa receptor γ2 subunit heterozygous (γ2(+/-)) mice, which we previously characterized as a model animal with construct, face, and predictive validity for major depressive disorder.to assess possible consequences of gabaergic deficits on glutamatergic transmission, we quantitated the cell surface expression of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda)-type and alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (ampa)-type glutamate receptors and the function of synapses in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex of γ2(+/-) mice. we also analyzed the effects of an acute dose of the experimental antidepressant ketamine on all these parameters in γ2(+/-) versus wild-type mice.modest defects in gabaergic synaptic transmission of γ2(+/-) mice resulted in a strikingly prominent homeostatic-like reduction in the cell surface expression of nmda-type and ampa-type glutamate receptors, along with prominent functional impairment of glutamatergic synapses in the hippocampus and medial prefrontal cortex. a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine normalized glutamate receptor expression and synaptic function of γ2(+/-) mice to wild-type levels for a prolonged period, along with antidepressant-like behavioral consequences selectively in γ2(+/-) mice. the gabaergic synapses of γ2(+/-) mice were potentiated by ketamine in parallel but only in the medial prefrontal cortex.depressive-like brain states that are caused by gabaergic deficits involve a homeostatic-like reduction of glutamatergic transmission that is reversible by an acute, subanesthetic dose of ketamine, along with regionally selective potentiation of gabaergic synapses. the data merge the gabaergic and glutamatergic deficit hypotheses of major depressive disorder.",Ren Z,2016,Biol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2016.02.009,27062563,Ren Z; Pribiag H; Jefferson SJ; Shorey M; Fuchs T; Stellwagen D; Luscher B,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D003865: Depressive Disorder, Major; D015536: Down-Regulation; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D006624: Hippocampus; D006706: Homeostasis; D007649: Ketamine; D051379: Mice; D017397: Prefrontal Cortex; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D011963: Receptors, GABA-A; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D013569: Synapses; D005680: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W2315792699,136,15,1,1969,301,6
false,galactosamine hepatotoxicity: effect of galactosamine on glutathione resynthesis in rat primary hepatocyte cultures,"the effect of galactosamine on the resynthesis of glutathione in rat primary hepatocyte cultures was investigated. cultured rat hepatocytes were treated with galactosamine (4 mm) 1.5 hr prior to concurrent with, or 1.5 hr after cell attachment; total cellular glutathione was then measured over time. addition of galactosamine at any of these times suppressed methionine-enhanced glutathione resynthesis in the cultures after a lag period of about 120 min. the lag period was not due to slow uptake of galactosamine by the cultured cells, since cellular utp levels fell to less than 10% of controls within 60 min, a time frame comparable to that observed in vivo. neither was the lag period a result of interference with cellular uptake of methionine or with conversion of methionine to cysteine, since the phenomenon was observed regardless of whether methionine or cysteine was used to promote glutathione resynthesis. addition of uridine, which protects against galactosamine hepatotoxicity in vivo by replenishing hepatic utp levels, did not prevent the suppression of glutathione resynthesis. the data indicate that (a) galactosamine inhibits the time-dependent resynthesis of glutathione in primary hepatocyte cultures, (b) a lag period exists for this response, and (c) this effect is not directly related to depletion of cellular utp stores.",McMillan JM,1992,Toxicol Appl Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0041-008x(92)90328-p,1641857,McMillan JM; Jollow DJ,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D003545: Cysteine; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D005688: Galactosamine; D005978: Glutathione; D007770: L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; D008099: Liver; D008297: Male; D008715: Methionine; D051381: Rats; D014544: Uridine Triphosphate",,,https://openalex.org/W2053563867,115,14,1,1349,230,7

false,endothelin-1 depresses tracheal mucus velocity in ovine airways via et-a receptors.,"endothelin-1 (et-1) is a potent constrictor of bronchial smooth muscle, but there is limited information on its actions on the airway mucociliary clearance in vivo. the purpose of this study was to determine (1) the effect of aerosolized et-1 on tracheal mucus velocity (tmv), a marker of mucociliary clearance, in sheep and (2) if the et-1-induced effects were mediated by et-a or et-b receptors. to measure tmv, radiopaque teflon particles were insufflated into six intubated, spontaneously breathing, adult sheep, and the velocity at which these particles traveled up the trachea was measured using a previously reported roentgenographic technique. after baseline tmv measurements, 50 breaths of either et-1 (10(-7) m) or vehicle (phosphate-buffered saline) were aerosolized into the airways. tmv measurements were then obtained over a 2-h period. after exposure to et-1, mean tmv decreased significantly as compared with vehicle, the effects being most marked within 30 min after administration (54%, p < 0.05). on subsequent days, animals were pretreated with an aerosolized et-a receptor antagonist (bq-123) or an et-b receptor antagonist (bq-788) before exposure to et-1. when et-1 was given after bq-123, no significant drop in tmv was noted. in contrast, pretreatment with bq-788 exhibited no protective effect on the decrease in tmv. the et-1 effects were not influenced by pretreatment with either the cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor indomethacin or the leukotriene receptor antagonist mk-571, indicating that et-1-induced depression in tmv does not involve the activation of prostanoids or peptide leukotrienes. thus, exogenous et-1 reduces tmv, an in vivo effect that is mediated through stimulation of et-a receptors.",Sabater JR,1996,Am J Respir Crit Care Med,https://doi.org/10.1164/ajrccm.154.2.8756804,8756804,Sabater JR; Otero R; Abraham WM; Wanner A; O'Riordan TG,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000336: Aerosols; D000818: Animals; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D065128: Endothelin Receptor Antagonists; D016232: Endothelins; D005260: Female; D009079: Mucociliary Clearance; D009842: Oligopeptides; D010456: Peptides, Cyclic; D010880: Piperidines; D011138: Polytetrafluoroethylene; D044022: Receptor, Endothelin A; D044023: Receptor, Endothelin B; D017466: Receptors, Endothelin; D012756: Sheep; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2052165965,83,12,1,1725,306,11

false,elevated phosphorus impedes manganese acquisition by barley plants,"the occurrence of manganese (mn) deficiency in cereal crops has increased in recent years. this coincides with increasing phosphorus (p) status of many soils due to application of high levels of animal manure. in order to test the hypothesis that elevated p my lead to mn deficiency we have here conducted a series of hydroponics and soil experiments examining how the p supply affects the mn nutrition of barley. evidence for a direct negative interaction between p and mn during root uptake was obtained by online inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (icp-ms). addition of a pulse of kh2po4 rapidly and significantly reduced root mn uptake, while a similar concentration of kcl had no effect. addition of a similar p pulse to the same nutrient solution without plants did not affect the concentration of mn, revealing that no precipitation of mn-p species was occurring. barley plants growing at a high p supply in hydroponics with continuous replenishment of mn had up to 50% lower mn concentration in the youngest leaves than p limited plants. this p-induced depression of foliar mn accelerated the development of mn deficiency as evidenced by a marked change in the fluorescence induction kinetics of chlorophyll a. also plants growing in soil exhibited lower leaf mn concentrations in response to elevated p. in contrast, leaf concentrations of fe, cu and n increased with the p supply, supporting that the negative effect of p on mn acquisition was specific rather than due to a general dilution effect. it is concluded that elevated p supply directly interferes with mn uptake in barley roots and that this negative interaction can induce mn deficiency in the shoot. this finding has major implications in commercial plant production where many soils have high p levels.",Pedas P,2011,Front Plant Sci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2011.00037,22639592,Pedas P; Husted S; Skytte K; Schjoerring JK,article,D016428: Journal Article,,,,https://openalex.org/W2076149960,66,8,1,1786,314,11

false,inhibition of long‐term potentiation by cuzn superoxide dismutase injection in rat dentate gyrus: involvement of muscarinic m1 receptor,"abstract long‐term potentiation (ltp) and long‐term depression represent important processes that modulate synaptic transmission that carries out a key role in neural mechanisms of memory. many studies give strong evidences on a role of the reactive oxygen species in the induction of ltp in ca1 region of hippocampal slices that was inhibited by adding the scavenger enzyme superoxide dismutase (sod1). previous data showed that sod1 is secreted by many cellular lines, including neuroblastoma sk‐n‐be cells through microvesicles by an atp‐dependent mechanism; moreover, it has been shown that sod1 interacts with human neuroblastoma cell membranes increasing intracellular calcium levels via a phospholipase c–protein kinase c pathway activation. the aim of this study was to investigate the effect of intracerebral injection of sod1 or the inactive form of enzyme (aposod) on the modulation of synaptic transmission in dentate gyrus of the hippocampus in urethane anesthetized rats. the results of the present research showed that intracerebral injection of sod1 and aposod in the dentate gyrus of the rat hippocampal formation inhibits ltp induced by high‐frequency stimulation of the perforant path. this result cannot be only explained by the dismutation of oxygen radical induced by sod1 since also aposod, that lacks the enzymatic activity, carries out the same inhibitory effect on ltp induction. j. cell. physiol. 227: 3111–3115, 2012. © 2011 wiley periodicals, inc.",Viggiano A,2012,J Cell Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.23062,22015651,Viggiano A; Serù R; Damiano S; De Luca B; Santillo M; Mondola P,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D045744: Cell Line, Tumor; D018891: Dentate Gyrus; D015870: Gene Expression; D006801: Humans; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D008297: Male; D009447: Neuroblastoma; D009836: Oligodendroglia; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D043643: Receptor, Muscarinic M1; D013482: Superoxide Dismutase; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2066443666,135,19,1,1476,246,11
false,biting releases constraints on moray eel feeding kinematics,"we present an analysis of prey capture functional morphology in eels by comparing two species of moray eels, muraena retifera and echidna nebulosa (family muraenidae), to the american eel anguilla rostrata (family anguillidae). the skulls of both moray species exhibited extreme reductions of several prominent components of the suction-feeding mechanism, including the hyoid bar, the sternohyoideus muscle and the pectoral girdle. associated with these anatomical modifications, morays showed no evidence of using suction during prey capture. from 59 video sequences of morays feeding on pieces of cut squid we saw no hyoid depression and no movement of prey toward the mouth aperture during the strike, a widely used indicator of suction-induced water flow. this was in contrast to a. rostrata, which exhibited a robust hyoid, sternohyoideus muscle and pectoral girdle, and used suction to draw prey into its mouth. average prey capture time in morays, about 500 ms, was roughly 10 times longer than in a. rostrata, and morays frequently reversed the direction of jaw and head rotation in the midst of the strike. we tested whether the absence of suction feeding reduces temporal constraints on feeding kinematics, permitting greater variance in traits that characterize timing and the extent of motion in the neurocranium, by comparing moray eel species with a. rostrata, two centrarchids and a cichlid. kinematic variance was roughly 5 times higher in morays than the suction-feeding species. prey capture by suction demands a rapid, highly coordinated series of cranial movements and the loss of this mechanism appears to have permitted slower, more variable prey capture kinematics in morays. the alternative prey capture strategy in morays, biting, may be tied to their success as predators in the confined spaces of reef crevices where they hunt for cephalopods, crustaceans and fish.",Mehta RS,2007,J Exp Biol,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.02663,17234619,Mehta RS; Wainwright PC,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",D000818: Animals; D001696: Biomechanical Phenomena; D004524: Eels; D005247: Feeding Behavior; D007568: Jaw; D011235: Predatory Behavior; D012886: Skull; D013045: Species Specificity,,,https://openalex.org/W2028075887,59,8,1,1892,326,10
false,interaction between the serotonergic system and hpa and hpt axes in patients with major depression: implications for pathogenesis of suicidal behavior.,"disturbances in the serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-ht) system constitute the neurobiological abnormality most consistently associated with suicide. this abnormality could be a marker of vulnerability predisposing individuals to auto-aggressive and impulsive behavior. however, other abnormalities, such as hyperactivity of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis, have also been described in suicide victims. while inhibitory effects of adrenocorticosteroids on 5-ht(1a) receptor function have been shown in animals, hpa axis hyperactivity does not seem to be responsible for the reduced 5-ht activity found in depressed patients with a history of suicidal behavior. on the other hand, hypothalamic-pituitarythyroid (hpt) axis dysfunction, frequently observed in depression, may represent a compensatory response to reduced central 5-ht neurotransmission. moreover, in depressed patients with a history of suicidal behavior, the absence of a functional link between hpt and dopamine activity at the hypothalamic level may be implicated in the pathophysiology of suicidal behavior. future research is needed to determine why compensatory mechanisms are not efficient in patients with suicidal behavior.",Duval F,2002,Dialogues Clin Neurosci,10.31887/dcns.2002.4.4/fduval,22033833,Duval F; Mokrani MC; Monreal J; Weiss T; Fattah S; Hamel B; Macher JP,article,D016428: Journal Article,,,,https://openalex.org/W55185480,151,23,1,1210,186,7

false,ezogabine (kcnq2/3 channel opener) prevents delayed activation of meningeal nociceptors if given before but not after the occurrence of cortical spreading depression,"we proposed recently that induction of delayed activation of trigeminovascular neurons by cortical spreading depression (csd) can explain the delayed onset of headache after the migraine aura (""aura""). this prompted us to search for ways to block the neuronal activation by csd - a preclinical correlate of an attempt to find a drug that can block the initiation of headache when administered shortly after onset of aura (i.e., preemptively). because migraine headache and epileptic seizures are comorbid chronic neurological disorders characterized by hyperexcitable brain networks, we began the search for such goal with an m-type potassium channel opener. we opted to use ezogabine, recently approved by the fda as adjunctive treatment of partial onset seizures in adults, because it is a selective kcnq2/3 channel opener. when csd was induced before ezogabine injection (8.25 mg/kg, i.p.), 40% (6/15) of the units doubled their firing rate about 45 min later for about 95 min. similarly, when csd was induced before vehicle was injected (4% dmso, 0.5% methylcellulose), 50% (3/6) of the units doubled their firing rate about 30 min later for about 120 min. when csd was triggered 1h after ezogabine injection, it activated only 8% of the units. by itself, ezogabine injection resulted in a 30% attenuation of ongoing firing in all 10 control units. thus, activation of kcnq2/3 channels during the aura is unlikely to preempt the onset of headache but may reduce the incidence of migraine if given during prodromes that precede the headache by hours. given the mechanistic similarities between migraine aura and epileptic seizures, it may be worthwhile to determine whether preemptive administration of ezogabine can prevent oncoming seizures in patients whose warning signs precede their seizures by more than an hour.",Zhang X,2013,Epilepsy Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yebeh.2013.02.029,23562239,Zhang X; Jakubowski M; Buettner C; Kainz V; Gold M; Burstein R,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D000927: Anticonvulsants; D002219: Carbamates; D013181: Cortical Spreading Depression; D004334: Drug Administration Schedule; D008297: Male; D009619: Nociceptors; D010147: Pain Measurement; D010655: Phenylenediamines; D010812: Physical Stimulation; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013268: Stimulation, Chemical; D013997: Time Factors; D012668: Trigeminal Ganglion",,,https://openalex.org/W2127337937,165,24,1,1822,331,11

false,protection by verapamil of mitochondrial glutathione equilibrium and phospholipid changes during reperfusion of ischemic canine myocardium.,"pretreatment of the ischemic myocardium with verapamil protects against mitochondrial respiratory depression observed during ischemic arrest as well as during reperfusion. since ischemic mitochondrial function appears not to be altered further by reperfusion, the purpose of this study is to identify a biochemical event affecting mitochondria that is specifically associated with reperfusion injury. it has been proposed that increased cellular ca2+ influx and oxygen toxicity may result from reintroduction of coronary flow. increased cytosolic ca2+ is transmitted to the mitochondria with subsequent activation of ca2+-dependent events, including phospholipase a2. net production of lysophospholipids (and loss of total diacylphospholipids from the mitochondria) will proceed when reacylation mechanisms are inhibited. since acyl-coa:lysophospholipid acyltransferase is a sulfhydryl-sensitive enzyme and since increased activity of glutathione peroxidase shifts the levels of the mitochondrial sulfhydryl buffer, glutathione, towards oxidation, levels of glutathione and its oxidation state were measured during reperfusion in the absence or presence of verapamil pretreatment. ischemia lowers total glutathione and reduces the redox ratio (reduced glutathione: oxidized glutathione) by 85%. reperfusion partially returns the redox ratio to control by causing oxidized glutathione to disappear from the matrix. verapamil maintains both the concentration and the redox potential of glutathione at control levels. concomitant with alterations in reduced glutathione:oxidized glutathione is a decrease in ischemic mitochondrial phospholipid content. during reperfusion, phosphatidylethanolamine and its major constituent fatty acids (c 18:0 and c 20:4) are specifically lost from the mitochondrial membrane. accompanying the significant loss of arachidonic acid during reperfusion is the decreased content of 11-oh, 12-oh, and 15-oh arachidonate. these lipid peroxidation products are not increased in ischemia. it is proposed that oxidation of matrix glutathione to glutathione disulfide during ischemia results in formation of glutathione-protein mixed disulfides and inhibition of sulfhydryl-sensitive proteins, including acyl-coa lysophosphatide acyltransferase. thus, metabolic events occurring within the ischemic period set the stage for prolonged dysfunction during reperfusion.",Kajiyama K,1987,Circ Res,https://doi.org/10.1161/01.res.61.2.301,3621493,Kajiyama K; Pauly DF; Hughes H; Yoon SB; Entman ML; McMillin-Wood JB,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000102: Acetyl-CoA C-Acyltransferase; D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D003327: Coronary Disease; D004285: Dogs; D005227: Fatty Acids; D005260: Female; D005978: Glutathione; D005979: Glutathione Peroxidase; D008297: Male; D008929: Mitochondria, Heart; D010084: Oxidation-Reduction; D010477: Perfusion; D010741: Phospholipases A; D054467: Phospholipases A2; D010743: Phospholipids; D014700: Verapamil",,,https://openalex.org/W2134066515,139,17,1,2386,344,15

false,virogenetic and optogenetic mechanisms to define potential therapeutic targets in psychiatric disorders,"a continuously increasing body of knowledge shows that the brain is an extremely complex neural network and single neurons possess their own complicated interactive signaling pathways. such complexity of the nervous system makes it increasingly difficult to investigate the functions of specific neural components such as genes, proteins, transcription factors, neurons and nuclei in the brain. technically, it has been even more of a significant challenge to identify the molecular and cellular adaptations that are both sufficient and necessary to underlie behavioral functions in health and disease states. defining such neural adaptations is a critical step to identify the potential therapeutic targets within the complex neural network that are beneficial to treat psychiatric disorders. recently, the new development and extensive application of in vivo viral-mediated gene transfer (virogenetics) and optical manipulation of specific neurons or selective neural circuits in freely-moving animals (optogenetics) make it feasible, through loss- and gain-of-function approaches, to reliably define sufficient and necessary neuroadaptations in the behavioral models of psychiatric disorders, including drug addiction, depression, anxiety and bipolar disorders. in this article, we focus on recent studies that successfully employ these advanced virogenetic and optogenetic techniques as a powerful tool to identify potential targets in the brain, and to provide highly useful information in the development of novel therapeutic strategies for psychiatric disorders. this article is part of a special issue entitled ‘anxiety and depression’. ► a systematic research strategy with a target defining loop is introduced. ► virogenetic and optogenetic approaches are used as an effective target defining tool. ► focusing on the neuronal activity during the target defining is highly important. ► the identified potential therapeutic targets and related studies are reviewed.",Han MH,2012,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.09.009,21945288,Han MH; Friedman AK,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454: Review","D000818: Animals; D005814: Genes, Viral; D005821: Genetic Techniques; D005822: Genetic Vectors; D006801: Humans; D001523: Mental Disorders; D008954: Models, Biological; D055095: Optics and Photonics",,,https://openalex.org/W1998952136,103,12,1,1973,306,11

false,endocannabinoid-mediated long-term depression of afferent excitatory synapses in hippocampal pyramidal cells and gabaergic interneurons,"although endocannabinoids have emerged as essential retrograde messengers in several forms of synaptic plasticity, it remains controversial whether they mediate long-term depression (ltd) of glutamatergic synapses onto excitatory and inhibitory neurons in the hippocampus. here, we show that parvalbumin- and somatostatin/metabotropic glutamate receptor 1(a) (mglu(1a))-positive gabaergic interneurons express diacylglycerol lipase-α (dgl-α), a synthesizing enzyme of the endocannabinoid 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-ag), albeit at lower levels than principal cells. moreover, this lipase accumulates postsynaptically around afferent excitatory synapses in all three cell types. to address the role of retrograde 2-ag signaling in ltd, we investigated two forms: (1) produced by postsynaptic spiking paired with subsequent presynaptic stimulation or (2) induced by group i mglu activation by (s)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (dhpg). neither form of ltd was evoked in the presence of the mglu(5) antagonist mpep [2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)-pyridine], the dgl inhibitor thl [n-formyl-l-leucine (1s)-1-[[(2s,3s)-3-hexyl-4-oxo-2-oxetanyl]methyl]dodecyl ester], or the intracellularly applied ca(2+) chelator bapta in ca1 pyramidal cells, fast-spiking interneurons (representing parvalbumin-containing cells) and interneurons projecting to stratum lacunosum-moleculare (representing somatostatin/mglu(1a)-expressing interneurons). both forms of ltd were completely absent in cb(1) cannabinoid receptor knock-out mice, whereas pharmacological blockade of cb(1) led to inconsistent results. notably, in accordance with their lower dgl-α level, a higher stimulation frequency or higher dhpg concentration was required for ltd induction in interneurons compared with pyramidal cells. these findings demonstrate that hippocampal principal cells and interneurons produce endocannabinoids to mediate ltd in a qualitatively similar, but quantitatively different manner. the shifted induction threshold implies that endocannabinoid-ltd contributes to cortical information processing during distinct network activity patterns in a cell type-specific manner.",Péterfi Z,2012,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.1676-12.2012,23055515,Péterfi Z; Urbán GM; Papp OI; Németh B; Monyer H; Szabó G; Erdélyi F; Mackie K; Freund TF; Hájos N; Katona I,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D063388: Endocannabinoids; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D006624: Hippocampus; D007395: Interneurons; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D018345: Mice, Knockout; D009475: Neurons, Afferent; D017966: Pyramidal Cells; D013569: Synapses; D005680: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W2122238125,135,14,1,2137,343,9

true,relationship between dopamine deficit and the expression of depressive behavior resulted from alteration of serotonin system,"depression frequently accompanies in parkinson's disease (pd). previous research suggested that dopamine (da) and serotonin systems are closely linked with depression in pd. however, comprehensive studies about the relationship between these two neurotransmitter systems are limited. therefore, the purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of dopaminergic destruction on the serotonin system. the interconnection between motor and depression was also examined. two pet scans were performed in the 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) lesioned and sham operated rats: [(18) f]fp-cit for da transporters and [(18) f]mefway for serotonin 1a (5-ht(1a)) receptors. here, 6-ohda is a neurotoxin for dopaminergic neurons. behavioral tests were used to evaluate the severity of symptoms: rotational number for motor impairment and immobility time, acquired from the forced swim test for depression. region-of-interests were drawn in the striatum and cerebellum for the da system and hippocampus and cerebellum for the 5-ht system. the cerebellum was chosen as a reference region. nondisplaceable binding potential in the striatum and hippocampus were compared between 6-ohda and sham groups. as a result, the degree of da depletion was negatively correlated with rotational behavior (r(2) = 0.79, p = 0.003). in 6-ohda lesioned rats, binding values for 5-ht(1a) receptors was 22% lower than the sham operated group. this decrement of 5-ht(1a) receptor binding was also correlated with the severity of depression (r(2) = 0.81, p = 0.006). taken together, this research demonstrated that the destruction of dopaminergic system causes the reduction of the serotonergic system resulting in the expression of depressive behavior. the degree of dopaminergic dysfunction was positively correlated with the impairment of the serotonin system. severity of motor symptoms was also closely related to depressive behavior.",Lee M,2015,Synapse,https://doi.org/10.1002/syn.21834,26089169,Lee M; Ryu YH; Cho WG; Kang YW; Lee SJ; Jeon TJ; Lyoo CH; Kim CH; Kim DG; Lee K; Choi TH; Choi JY,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004298: Dopamine; D050483: Dopamine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; D059290: Dopaminergic Neurons; D009069: Movement Disorders; D016627: Oxidopamine; D010879: Piperazines; D049268: Positron-Emission Tomography; D011725: Pyridines; D019275: Radiopharmaceuticals; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D044282: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A; D012701: Serotonin; D014326: Tropanes",,,https://openalex.org/W2154937615,124,16,1,1899,342,17

true,quetiapine prevents anhedonia induced by acute or chronic stress,"the role of atypical antipsychotics as add-on treatments and as primary mood stabilizers in different phases of bipolar disorder is an important current research area. although in bipolar patients the main therapeutic indication of quetiapine (qtp) is the management of acute mania, several observations suggest that this agent may exert antidepressant as well as antimanic effects. however, in our knowledge, there are no preclinical studies supporting this hypothesis. thus, the main goal of the present work was to evaluate the putative antidepressant effect of qtp (0.4, 2.0, or 10 mg/kg/day), in comparison to amitriptyline (ami) (2 or 5 mg/kg/day), in rats exposed to acute or chronic stress. the administration of qtp, 2 mg/kg/day, prevents the onset of anhedonia in rats exposed to a 6-week chronic mild stress (cms) protocol. the effect of qtp has a slow onset, beginning at week 5, and causes a complete recovery from anhedonia. in this respect, the effect of qtp is similar to that obtained after chronic administration of ami 2 or 5 mg/kg/day. our findings also indicate that a 6-week administration of qtp, 2 or 10 mg/kg/day, has protective effects against the onset of anhedonia caused by the exposure to an acute subthreshold stressful event in rats that have previously experienced the cms procedure. the results suggest that qtp is able to prevent both the transient mood depression caused by acute stress and the long-lasting anhedonic state induced by exposure, over a period of weeks, to a variety of unpredictable mild stressors.",Orsetti M,2007,Neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1301291,17213846,Orsetti M; Canonico PL; Dellarole A; Colella L; Di Brisco F; Ghi P,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000639: Amitriptyline; D000818: Animals; D000929: Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D003987: Dibenzothiazepines; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005518: Food Preferences; D008297: Male; D019964: Mood Disorders; D000069348: Quetiapine Fumarate; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013312: Stress, Physiological; D013395: Sucrose; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2009352908,64,9,1,1550,284,9

false,inhibition of histamine release from rat mast cells by cytochalasin a and other sulfhydryl reagents,"we adduce several lines of evidence to indicate that the inhibition of histamine release from rat mast cells by cytochalasin a (cyto a) depends on its reactivity with mast cell sulfhydryl (sh) groups: (1) cyto a reacts with cysteine, glutathione and protein sh groups ; (2) prior reaction of cyto a with glutathione eliminates its inhibitory action; and (3) 2,2'-dithiodipyridine (dtdp), a sh reagent with greater specificity for sh groups and very different structure from cyto a, has parallel inhibitory effects on mast cell secretion. inhibition of histamine release by cyto a or by dtdp is independent of depression of cell atp or cell glutathione. inhibition of release induced by the calcium ionophore a23187 and polymyxin suggests that the two sh reagents act to block the release mechanism subsequent to a putative increase in cytoplasmic ca2+ concentration. in contrast, n(7-dimethylamino-4-methylcoumarinyl)maleimide (dacm), p-chloromercuri-benzene sulfonate (pcmbs) and n-ethylmaleimide (nem) (< 10−5 m) appear to react with a sh group required for polymyxin b but not a23187-induced release. the effect of nem at high concentrations (5 × 10−5 m) is attributable to depression of cell atp.",Lagunoff D,1979,Biochem Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(79)90538-0,89848,Lagunoff D; Wan H,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000818: Animals; D003572: Cytochalasins; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D005978: Glutathione; D006636: Histamine Release; D008297: Male; D008407: Mast Cells; D051381: Rats; D013439: Sulfhydryl Reagents",,,https://openalex.org/W1998264906,99,15,1,1200,221,5
false,change in bi‐directional plasticity at ca1 synapses in hippocampal slices taken from 6‐hydroxydopamine‐treated rats: the role of endogenous norepinephrine,"abstract the object of the present study is to investigate the role of endogenous adrenergic innervation in regulating bi‐directional synaptic plasticity in rat hippocampal ca1 synapses. the endogenous adrenergic system was eliminated by giving subcutaneous injection of 6‐hydroxydopamine (6‐ohda) to rats immediately after birth, and the animals were killed for experiments at postnatal ages of 25–35 days. in hippocampal slices taken from 6‐ohda‐treated animals, theta‐burst stimulation at 100 hz failed to induce long‐term potentiation (ltp) at ca1 synapses. however, the induction of long‐term depression (ltd) by prolonged low frequency stimulation at 1 hz was unaffected in slices from 6‐ohda‐treated animals. bath application of norepinephrine (ne) restored ltp to control levels and blocked ltd. this effect was mimicked by β‐ but not α‐adrenergic receptor agonists, i.e. by isoproterenol but not phenylephrine. the activators of adenylyl cyclase and protein kinase a (pka), i.e. forskolin and 8‐bromoadenosine‐3′, 5′‐cyclic monophosphate, respectively, restored ltp in slices from 6‐ohda‐treated animals. in addition, application of the d1/d5 receptor agonist, dihydrexidine, also restored ltp in slices from 6‐ohda‐treated animals. these results suggest that physiologically the recruitment of catecholamine innervation may be important for induction of ltp at hippocampal ca1 synapses during tetanic stimulation, while it may not be essential for ltd induction by prolonged 1 hz stimulation. the released ne and dopamine exert their role in modulating synaptic plasticity via activation of β‐adrenergic and d1/d5 receptors, respectively, which in turn increase the levels of cytoplasm adenosine‐3′,5′‐cyclic monophosphate and pka.",Yang HW,2002,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2002.02165.x,12383241,Yang HW; Lin YW; Yen CD; Min MY,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000316: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; D000318: Adrenergic beta-Agonists; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D001369: Axons; D017868: Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; D018491: Dopamine Agonists; D006624: Hippocampus; D008125: Locus Coeruleus; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D009410: Nerve Degeneration; D009434: Neural Pathways; D009638: Norepinephrine; D016627: Oxidopamine; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2022319186,154,20,1,1741,277,12
false,alzheimer disease-related presenilin-1 variants exert distinct effects on monoamine oxidase-a activity in vitro,"monoamine oxidase-a (mao-a) has been associated with both depression and alzheimer disease (ad). recently, carriers of ad-related presenilin-1 (ps-1) alleles have been found to be at higher risk for developing clinical depression. we chose to examine whether ps-1 could influence mao-a function in vitro. overexpression of selected ad-related ps-1 variants (wildtype, y115h, δex9 and m146v) in mouse hippocampal ht-22 cells affects mao-a catalytic activity in a variant-specific manner. the ability of the ps-1 substrate-competitor dapt to induce mao-a activity in cells expressing either ps-1 wildtype or ps-1(m146v) suggests the potential for a direct influence of ps-1 on mao-a function. in support of this, we were able to co-immunoprecipitate mao-a with flag-tagged ps-1 wildtype and m146v proteins. this potential for a direct protein-protein interaction between ps-1 and mao-a is not specific for ht-22 cells as we were also able to co-immunoprecipitate mao-a with flag-ps-1 variants in n2a mouse neuroblastoma cells and in hek293 human embryonic kidney cells. finally, we demonstrate that the two ps-1 variants reported to be associated with an increased incidence of clinical depression [e.g., a431e and l235v] both induce mao-a activity in ht-22 cells. a direct influence of ps-1 variants on mao-a function could provide an explanation for the changes in monoaminergic tone observed in several neurodegenerative processes including ad. the ability to induce mao-a catalytic activity with a ps-1/γ-secretase inhibitor should also be considered when designing secretase inhibitor-based therapeutics.",Pennington PR,2011,J Neural Transm (Vienna),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-011-0616-7,21373759,Pennington PR; Wei Z; Rui L; Doig JA; Graham B; Kuski K; Gabriel GG; Mousseau DD,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000544: Alzheimer Disease; D000818: Animals; D002461: Cell Line, Transformed; D045744: Cell Line, Tumor; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D014644: Genetic Variation; D057809: HEK293 Cells; D006801: Humans; D051379: Mice; D008995: Monoamine Oxidase; D009447: Neuroblastoma; D009474: Neurons; D053764: Presenilin-1",,,https://openalex.org/W2049438270,111,13,1,1607,261,10
false,pollination ecology and inbreeding depression control individual flowering phenologies and mixed mating,"we analyze evolution of individual flowering phenologies by combining an ecological model of pollinator behavior with a genetic model of inbreeding depression for plant viability. the flowering phenology of a plant genotype determines its expected daily floral display which, together with pollinator behavior, governs the population rate of geitonogamous selfing (fertilization among flowers on the same plant). pollinators select plant phenologies in two ways: they are more likely to visit plants displaying more flowers per day, and they influence geitonogamous selfing and consequent inbreeding depression via their abundance, foraging behavior, and pollen carry-over among flowers on a plant. our model predicts two types of equilibria at stable intermediate selfing rates for a wide range of pollinator behaviors and pollen transfer parameters. edge equilibria occur at maximal or minimal selfing rates and are constrained by pollinators. internal equilibria occur between edge equilibria and are determined by a trade-off between pollinator attraction to large floral displays and avoidance of inbreeding depression due to selfing. we conclude that unavoidable geitonogamous selfing generated by pollinator behavior can contribute to the common occurrence of stable mixed mating in plants.",Devaux C,2014,Evolution,https://doi.org/10.1111/evo.12507,25130655,Devaux C; Lande R; Porcher E,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D005075: Biological Evolution; D007178: Inbreeding; D019684: Magnoliopsida; D008954: Models, Biological; D018521: Plant Physiological Phenomena; D054817: Pollination; D060436: Self-Incompatibility in Flowering Plants",,,https://openalex.org/W2118353772,103,12,1,1297,199,7

false,asas centennial paper: future research in physiology and endocrinology,"over the next quarter century in north america, the following eventualities are likely for physiology and endocrinology research with agricultural animals. 1) total funding adjusted for inflation will change little but will come less from public sources, and most of that will be in the context of human health. much of the privately funded research will be herd specific and remain proprietary. 2) the numbers of ms, phd, and postdoctoral students probably will decrease, but research in the context of credentialing will remain important. 3) resources such as expanded databases in genomics and proteomics, and remarkable new tools such as small inhibitory rna will continue to become available, likely at a faster rate than in the previous 25 yr. 4) the huge amounts of data from production agriculture will make agricultural animals ideal models for some kinds of basic research, such as studying fetal programming, resulting in synergy with more applied research. most of these experimental animals will be in private production herds and flocks, even when work is publicly funded. 5) the trend toward more interdisciplinary research will continue, especially considering interactions among reproduction, health, nutrition, selective breeding, management factors, and societal concerns; reductionist research probing deeper into cellular and molecular mechanisms will remain important, as will whole-animal approaches. 6) agricultural animals are a product of evolution plus selective breeding. insights drawn from the former will aid progress in the latter. one focus of research in physiology and endocrinology will be understanding heterosis, inbreeding depression, and epigenetic effects as it becomes possible to manipulate and identify the allelic structure of individual animals. 7) additional insightful concepts will evolve that will simplify thinking in some respects, such as the maternal to embryonic shift in transcribed rna in early embryos; however, animal biology will turn out to be even more complex than most of us currently imagine.",Seidel GE,2009,J Anim Sci,https://doi.org/10.2527/jas.2008-1368,18765843,Seidel GE,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000383: Agriculture; D000818: Animals; D000829: Animals, Domestic; D004704: Endocrinology; D010827: Physiology; D012106: Research",,,https://openalex.org/W2101351240,70,10,1,2057,347,11

false,dopamine induces a glun2a-dependent form of long-term depression of nmda synaptic responses in the nucleus accumbens,"natural rewards and addictive drugs are believed to exert their reinforcing actions by influencing synaptic plasticity in reward-related brain regions such as the nucleus accumbens (nac). long-lasting changes in the efficacy of excitatory synaptic transmission in the nac are critically dependent on efficient interactions between the dopaminergic and the glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems. potential targets to the actions of dopamine and of addictive drugs include the glun2 subunits that compose the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) type of glutamate receptors. however, the ability of dopamine to induce synaptic plasticity by modulating specific subunits of the nmda receptor has not been examined. the present study shows that in the mouse nac, dopamine produces a long-lasting depression of nmda responses which occludes long-term depression (ltd) induced by high frequency stimulation (hfs) of glutamatergic fibers. ltd induced by dopamine or by hfs does not involve a change in the subunit composition of nmda receptors. although glun2b contributes to synaptic responses in the nac and is affected by dopamine, this subunit might not be a direct target to the actions of dopamine. the results, however, identify a critical role for glun2a in dopamine-induced and hfs-induced synaptic plasticity. this study suggests a possible mechanism of action for dopamine in the regulation of reward-related behaviors.",Chergui K,2011,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.01.047,21295045,Chergui K,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D004298: Dopamine; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009714: Nucleus Accumbens; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D010636: Phenols; D010880: Piperidines; D011810: Quinoxalines; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2063137145,116,16,1,1415,227,9

true,the quetiapine active metabolite n-desalkylquetiapine and the neurotensin nts₁ receptor agonist pd149163 exhibit antidepressant-like effects on operant responding in male rats.,"major depressive disorder is the most common mood disorder in the united states and european union; however, the limitations of clinically available antidepressant drugs have led researchers to pursue novel pharmacological treatments. clinical studies have reported that monotherapy with the atypical antipsychotic drug quetiapine produces a rapid reduction in depressive symptoms that is apparent after 1 week of treatment, and it is possible that the active metabolite n-desalkylquetiapine, which structurally resembles an antidepressant drug, produces antidepressant effects. neuropharmacological evaluations of the neurotensin nts1 receptor agonist pd149163 suggest antidepressant efficacy, but the effects of a nts₁ receptor agonist in an antidepressant animal model have yet to be reported. the present study examined the antidepressant-like effects of n-desalkylquetiapine, pd14916, quetiapine, the tricyclic antidepressant drug imipramine, the atypical antipsychotic drug risperidone, and the typical antipsychotic drug raclopride on responding in male sprague-dawley rats trained on a differential-reinforcement-of-low-rate 72-s operant schedule, a procedure used for screening antidepressant drugs. quetiapine, pd149163, risperidone, and imipramine exhibited antidepressant-like effects by increasing the number of reinforcers earned, decreasing the number of responses emitted, and shifting the interresponse time (irt) distributions to the right. n-desalkylquetiapine produced a partial antidepressant-like effect by decreasing the number of responses emitted and producing a rightward shift in the irt distributions, but it did not significantly alter the number of reinforcers earned. raclopride decreased reinforcers and responses. these data suggest that n-desalkylquetiapine likely contributes to quetiapine's antidepressant efficacy and identify nts₁ receptor activation as a potential novel pharmacologic strategy for antidepressant drugs.",Hillhouse TM,2014,Exp Clin Psychopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1037/a0038156,25285844,Hillhouse TM; Shankland Z; Matazel KS; Keiser AA; Prus AJ,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article,"D000478: Alkylation; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D018687: Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; D000929: Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D003216: Conditioning, Operant; D003865: Depressive Disorder, Major; D003987: Dibenzothiazepines; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D008297: Male; D009496: Neurotensin; D000069348: Quetiapine Fumarate; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D018028: Receptors, Neurotensin; D012054: Reinforcement, Psychology",,,https://openalex.org/W2015866365,176,22,1,1958,277,8

true,developmental nicotine exposure induced alterations in behavior and glutamate receptor function in hippocampus,"in the developing brain, nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nachrs) are involved in cell survival, targeting, formation of neural and sensory circuits, and development and maturation of other neurotransmitter systems. this regulatory role is disrupted when the developing brain is exposed to nicotine, which occurs with tobacco use during pregnancy. prenatal nicotine exposure has been shown to be a strong risk factor for memory deficits and other behavioral aberrations in the offspring. the molecular mechanisms underlying these neurobehavioral outcomes are not clearly elucidated. we used a rodent model to assess behavioral, neurophysiological, and neurochemical consequences of prenatal nicotine exposure in rat offspring with specific emphasis on the hippocampal glutamatergic system. pregnant dams were infused with nicotine (6 mg/kg/day) subcutaneously from the third day of pregnancy until birth. results indicate that prenatal nicotine exposure leads to increased anxiety and depressive-like effects and impaired spatial memory. synaptic plasticity in the form of long-term potentiation (ltp), basal synaptic transmission, and ampa receptor-mediated synaptic currents were reduced. the deficit in synaptic plasticity was paralleled by declines in protein levels of vesicular glutamate transporter 1 (vglut1), synaptophysin, ampa receptor subunit glur1, phospho(ser845) glur1, and postsynaptic density 95 (psd-95). these results suggest that prenatal nicotine exposure by maternal smoking could result in alterations in the glutamatergic system in the hippocampus contributing to the abnormal neurobehavioral outcomes.",Parameshwaran K,2012,Cell Mol Life Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00018-011-0805-4,22033836,Parameshwaran K; Buabeid MA; Karuppagounder SS; Uthayathas S; Thiruchelvam K; Shonesy B; Dityatev A; Escobar MC; Dhanasekaran M; Suppiramaniam V,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D004594: Electrophysiology; D005260: Female; D005786: Gene Expression Regulation; D006624: Hippocampus; D009538: Nicotine; D011247: Pregnancy; D011297: Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D017470: Receptors, Glutamate; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",,,https://openalex.org/W2015626820,110,13,1,1628,254,10

true,identification of antidepressant-like ingredients in ginseng root (panax ginseng c.a. meyer) using a menopausal depressive-like state in female mice: participation of 5-ht2a receptors,"rationale: after reports of adverse effects with hormone replacement therapy, such as reproductive and breast cancer and coronary heart disease, much attention has been given to the development of new remedies to alleviate menopausal depression in women, but methods for their preclinical evaluation have not been clarified. we previously developed a procedure to predict the drug effect on the menopausal depressive-like state in female mice.
objectives: we attempted to identify psychoactive components from ginseng root, one of the earliest known materials for menopausal disorder, and to clarify the possible mechanism involved.
methods: as an index of a depressive-like state, we used the prolongation of immobility time induced by an ovariectomy during the forced swimming test. chronic treatment with the candidate substance began the day after ovariectomy and continued for 14 days. to examine whether the 5-ht(2a) receptor antagonist ritanserin antagonized the antidepressant-like effect of ginsenoside rb(1), ritanserin was given as pretreatment 15 min before the daily administration of ginsenoside rb(1) and the antagonistic effect was compared with ginsenoside rb(1) alone.
results: ginsenoside rb(1) and compound k were active ingredients that dose-dependently prevented the prolongation of immobility time induced by ovariectomy. co-administration of ritanserin, a 5-ht(2a)-receptor antagonist, antagonized the effect of ginsenoside rb(1).
conclusions: we suggest that ginsenoside rb(1) and its metabolite, compound k, are antidepressant-like components of the ginseng root, and that 5-ht(2a) receptors may play an important role in mediating the antidepressant-like effect of ginsenoside rb(1).",Yamada N,2011,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-011-2252-1,21424694,Yamada N; Araki H; Yoshimura H,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D003863: Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005260: Female; D036145: Ginsenosides; D008593: Menopause; D051379: Mice; D008813: Mice, Inbred ICR; D010052: Ovariectomy; D005894: Panax; D008517: Phytotherapy; D010936: Plant Extracts; D018517: Plant Roots; D044402: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2A; D016713: Ritanserin; D013550: Swimming",,,https://openalex.org/W2071868502,183,27,2,1714,294,9
false,pparγ agonist improves neuronal insulin receptor function in hippocampus and brain mitochondria function in rats with insulin resistance induced by long term high-fat diets,"we previously demonstrated that a high-fat diet (hfd) consumption can cause not only peripheral insulin resistance, but also neuronal insulin resistance. moreover, the consumption of an hfd has been shown to cause mitochondrial dysfunction in both the skeletal muscle and liver. rosiglitazone, a peroxizome proliferator-activated receptor-γ ligand, is a drug used to treat type 2 diabetes mellitus. recent studies suggested that rosiglitazone can improve learning and memory in both human and animal models. however, the effects of rosiglitazone on neuronal insulin resistance and brain mitochondria after the hfd consumption have not yet been investigated. therefore, we tested the hypothesis that rosiglitazone improves neuronal insulin resistance caused by a hfd via attenuating the dysfunction of neuronal insulin receptors and brain mitochondria. rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg · d) was given for 14 d to rats that were fed with either a hfd or normal diet for 12 wk. after the 14(th) week, all animals were euthanized, and their brains were removed and examined for insulin-induced long-term depression, neuronal insulin signaling, and brain mitochondrial function. we found that rosiglitazone significantly improved peripheral insulin resistance and insulin-induced long-term depression and increased neuronal akt/pkb-ser phosphorylation in response to insulin. furthermore, rosiglitazone prevented brain mitochondrial conformational changes and attenuated brain mitochondrial swelling, brain mitochondrial membrane potential changes, and brain mitochondrial ros production. our data suggest that neuronal insulin resistance and the impairment of brain mitochondria caused by a 12-wk hfd consumption can be reversed by rosiglitazone.",Pipatpiboon N,2012,Endocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1210/en.2011-1502,22109891,Pipatpiboon N; Pratchayasakul W; Chattipakorn N; Chattipakorn SC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D059305: Diet, High-Fat; D006624: Hippocampus; D006801: Humans; D007004: Hypoglycemic Agents; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007328: Insulin; D007333: Insulin Resistance; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008297: Male; D008928: Mitochondria; D008959: Models, Neurological; D009474: Neurons; D047495: PPAR gamma; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D011972: Receptor, Insulin; D000077154: Rosiglitazone; D045162: Thiazolidinediones; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2082089391,172,24,1,1732,270,11
true,antidepressant dose of taurine increases mrna expression of gabaa receptor α2 subunit and bdnf in the hippocampus of diabetic rats,"diabetes mellitus is a metabolic disorder associated with higher risk for depression. diabetic rats present depressive-like behaviors and taurine, one of the most abundant free amino acids in the brain, reverses this depressive behaviors. because taurine is a gabaa agonist modulator, we hypothesize that its antidepressant effect results from the interaction on this system by changing α2 gabaa receptor subunit expression, beside changes on bdnf mrna, and memory in diabetic rats. streptozotocin-diabetic and non-diabetic wistar rats were daily injected with 100 mg/kg of taurine or saline, intraperitoneally, for 30 days. at the end of the experiment, rats were exposed to the novel object recognition memory. later they were euthanized, the brains were weighed, and the hippocampus was dissected for α2 gabaa subunit and bdnf mrna expression. real-time quantitative pcr (qpcr) showed that diabetic rats presented lower α2 gabaa subunit and bdnf mrna expression than non-diabetic rats and taurine increased both parameters in these sick rats. taurine also reversed the lower brain weight and improved the short-term memory in diabetic rats. thus, the taurine antidepressant effect may be explained by interference with the gaba system, in line to its neuroprotective effect showed here by preventing brain weight loss and improving memory in diabetic rats.",Caletti G,2015,Behav Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbr.2015.01.018,25612506,Caletti G; Almeida FB; Agnes G; Nin MS; Barros HM; Gomez R,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D019208: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; D003921: Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D057567: Memory, Long-Term; D008570: Memory, Short-Term; D009929: Organ Size; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D011963: Receptors, GABA-A; D021641: Recognition, Psychology; D013654: Taurine",,,https://openalex.org/W2054010986,130,20,1,1359,226,9

false,calcium‐dependent inactivation and depletion of synaptic cleft calcium ions combine to regulate rod calcium currents under physiological conditions,"l-type ca2+ currents (i(ca)) in rod photoreceptors exhibit ca2+-dependent inactivation. perforated-patch whole-cell recordings were obtained from isolated rods of the tiger salamander using 1.8 mm ca2+ in the bathing medium to determine the extent of ca2+-dependent inactivation of i(ca) with physiological [ca2+] and endogenous buffering. i(ca) was measured with voltage ramps applied before and after 5-s steps to -40, -30, -20, or -10 mv. long depolarizing steps in isolated rods produced inactivation of i(ca) ranging from 15% at -40 mv to > 80% at -10 mv. because, in addition to ca2+-dependent inactivation, depletion of synaptic cleft ca2+ accompanying activation of i(ca) can reduce presynaptic i(ca) at calycal synapses, we investigated whether a similar mechanism worked at the invaginating rod synapse. rods from retinal slices with intact synapses were compared with isolated rods in which synaptic cleft depletion is absent. i(ca) was more strongly depressed by depolarization of rods in retinal slices, with ica reduced by 47% following voltage steps to -40 mv. the depression of currents by depolarization was also greater for rods from retinal slices than isolated rods when ca2+ was replaced with ba2+ to reduce ca2+-dependent inactivation. the stronger depolarization-evoked inhibition of i(ca) in retinal slices compared to isolated rods probably reflects depletion of synaptic cleft ca2+ arising from sustained ca2+ influx. inactivation of i(ca) exhibited slow onset and recovery. these findings suggest that ca2+-dependent inactivation and depletion of synaptic cleft ca2+ may combine to regulate i(ca) in response to light-evoked changes in rod membrane potential.",Rabl K,2002,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2002.02277.x,12473074,Rabl K; Thoreson WB,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000557: Ambystoma; D000818: Animals; D001464: Barium; D002118: Calcium; D020746: Calcium Channels, L-Type; D020013: Calcium Signaling; D003623: Dark Adaptation; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005110: Extracellular Space; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009434: Neural Pathways; D017948: Retinal Rod Photoreceptor Cells; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D014785: Vision, Ocular",,,https://openalex.org/W2008224352,147,18,1,1686,303,11

true,toluene has antidepressant-like actions in two animal models used for the screening of antidepressant drugs,"rationale: many abused solvents share a profile of effects with classical antidepressants. for example, toluene, which is a representative and widely abused solvent, has been reported to increase both serotonin and noradrenaline levels in several brain areas after an acute exposure and to act as a noncompetitive antagonist of the glutamatergic n-methyl-d-aspartic acid (nmda) receptor subtype. therefore, it is possible that toluene could possess antidepressant-like actions.
objective: to provide an initial screening of toluene's antidepressant-like actions in the forced swimming test (fst) and the tail suspension test (tst) in mice and to analyze its possible mechanism of action.
materials and methods: two series of experiments were performed. in the first one, male animals were exposed to toluene (0, 500, 1,000, 2,000, or 4,000 ppm) in a static exposure chamber for 30 min, and immediately after, evaluated for antidepressant-like effects. the results were compared with those obtained from mice treated with the serotonergic antidepressant clomipramine (cmi), the noradrenergic antidepressant desipramine (dmi), and the glutamatergic antidepressants, ketamine and mk-801. in the second part, we analyzed the effect of a combined administration of a subeffective concentration of toluene with a suboptimal dose of the various antidepressants acting at different neurotransmitter systems.
results: toluene produced a concentration-dependent antidepressant-like action in the fst and tst and facilitated both mk-801 and ketamine antidepressant-like effects, but not those of dmi or cmi.
conclusions: toluene has antidepressant-like effects that are synergized with nmda receptor antagonists.",Cruz SL,2009,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-009-1462-2,19151967,Cruz SL; Soberanes-Chávez P; Páez-Martinez N; López-Rubalcava C,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D000929: Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; D002997: Clomipramine; D003891: Desipramine; D016291: Dizocilpine Maleate; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D019417: Hindlimb Suspension; D007649: Ketamine; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D009043: Motor Activity; D011597: Psychomotor Performance; D012997: Solvents; D013550: Swimming; D014050: Toluene",,,https://openalex.org/W2145869579,107,15,1,1705,281,10

false,minimal stimulus parameters and the effects of hyperpolarization on the induction of long-term potentiation in the cat motor cortex,"the aim of the research program of which the present work is a part is to understand the neural mechanisms involved in motor learning and memory. one of the mechanisms postulated to be involved in this process is the induction of long-term potentiation (ltp) in the motor cortex. ltp can be induced in motor cortical neurons by tetanic stimulation of their afferents from the somatosensory cortex. in the present study, the effects of different stimulating parameters on the induction of ltp were examined, using in-vivo, intracellular recordings from anesthetized cats. the expression of ltp was documented by measuring the amplitude and rise-time of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (epsps) before and after tetanic stimulation. the minimal tetanic stimulation capable of systematically inducing ltp was found to consist of a train of stimuli at 50 hz, 5 s. shorter trains of stimulation produced only a short-lasting, transient potentiation. in different cells, identical stimulation parameters resulted in different degrees of potentiation of synaptic responses. following all the stimulation trains examined, epsp amplitudes were transiently depressed before reaching potentiated levels. the duration of this depression was directly correlated with the duration and the frequency of the tetanic stimulation. in all the cells in which ltp was induced, the variability in the amplitudes of potentiated epsp was significantly greater than that of control epsp amplitudes. hyperpolarization of the postsynaptic cell, during the delivery of the tetanic stimulation, inhibited the induction of ltp. these phenomena are discussed in relation to the postulated mechanisms of ltp induction in the cortex.",Keller A,1991,Exp Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00231846,1769383,Keller A; Miyashita E; Asanuma H,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",D000344: Afferent Pathways; D000818: Animals; D002415: Cats; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D008297: Male; D008839: Microelectrodes; D009044: Motor Cortex; D009474: Neurons; D013003: Somatosensory Cortex; D013569: Synapses; D013997: Time Factors,,,https://openalex.org/W1986506685,131,19,1,1702,278,12
false,osmotic edema rapidly increases neuronal excitability through activation of nmda receptor-dependent slow inward currents in juvenile and adult hippocampus,"cellular edema (cell swelling) is a principal component of numerous brain disorders including ischemia, cortical spreading depression, hyponatremia, and epilepsy. cellular edema increases seizure-like activity in vitro and in vivo, largely through nonsynaptic mechanisms attributable to reduction of the extracellular space. however, the types of excitability changes occurring in individual neurons during the acute phase of cell volume increase remain unclear. using whole-cell patch clamp techniques, we report that one of the first effects of osmotic edema on excitability of ca1 pyramidal cells is the generation of slow inward currents (sics), which initiate after approximately 1 min. frequency of sics increased as osmolarity decreased in a dose-dependent manner. imaging of real-time volume changes in astrocytes revealed that neuronal sics occurred while astrocytes were still in the process of swelling. sics evoked by cell swelling were mainly nonsynaptic in origin and nmda receptor-dependent. to better understand the relationship between sics and changes in neuronal excitability, recordings were performed in increasingly physiological conditions. in the absence of any added pharmacological reagents or imposed voltage clamp, osmotic edema induced excitatory postsynaptic potentials and burst firing over the same timecourse as sics. like sics, action potentials were blocked by nmdar antagonists. effects were more pronounced in adult (8-20 weeks old) compared with juvenile (p15-p21) mice. together, our results indicate that cell swelling triggered by reduced osmolarity rapidly increases neuronal excitability through activation of nmda receptors. our findings have important implications for understanding nonsynaptic mechanisms of epilepsy in relation to cell swelling and reduction of the extracellular space.",Lauderdale K,2015,ASN Neuro,https://doi.org/10.1177/1759091415605115,26489684,Lauderdale K; Murphy T; Tung T; Davila D; Binder DK; Fiacco TA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000375: Aging; D000818: Animals; D001253: Astrocytes; D001929: Brain Edema; D056547: CA1 Region, Hippocampal; D002413: Cations, Divalent; D048429: Cell Size; D008274: Magnesium; D008297: Male; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009994: Osmolar Concentration; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D017966: Pyramidal Cells; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D046509: Tissue Culture Techniques",,,https://openalex.org/W2289528536,154,19,1,1833,285,13

false,reversed postoptokinetic nystagmus: a model of plasticity in the vestibuloocular system,"a simple manifestation of the memorial processes is the so called reversed postoptokinetic nystagmus (rpn), a trace phenomenon elicited in the rabbit by prolonged (60 min) optokinetic (ok) stimulation. electrophysiological analysis of rpn indicated that the underlying neural trace is weakened, but not suppressed by spreading depression in the cerebral cortex or superior colliculus. an asymmetry of rpn is brought about by unilateral 6-ohda lesion on substantia nigra. electroconvulsive shock applied immediately after a period of ok stimulation blocks the subsequent rpn without interfering with okn. about 70 percent of neurons in the vestibular complex changed their activity during okn and rpk. the changes consisted in most cases of an excitation accompanying okn and inhibition during rpn. the okn-rpn related reacti6ns were also abundant in flocculus but significant activity changes during rpn were less frequent in this structure. units in midbrain reticular formation reacted both during okn and rpn in a similar fashion as the vestibular ones. on the other hand units in the cerebellar deep nuclei and brachium conjunctivum were only weakly influenced by okn and/or rpn. it is suggested that the neural trace of rpn develops in the vestibular complex and vestibulocerebellum as a part of the process compensating the effect of continued optokinetic stimulation. flocculus participates in input processing of the optokinetic stimulation whereas reticular formation mediates signal transmission to oculomotor and higher integrating centers. the trace, revealed by sudden cessation of the eliciting stimulus in absence of visual reference signals is probably the neural substrate of the so called motion habituation and visual hallucinations. as other compensatory phenomena in the motor system, rpn has features of instrumental (it improves the organisms control of environment) and classical (it is automatically established and involuntarily emitted) conditioning.",Bures J,1979,Acta Neurobiol Exp (Wars),https://doi.org/10.1007/978-94-009-8225-3_7,547705,Bures J; Neverov VP,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D005133: Eye Movements; D006185: Habituation, Psychophysiologic; D008959: Models, Neurological; D011817: Rabbits; D013378: Substantia Nigra; D014726: Vestibular Nuclei",,,https://openalex.org/W2182849714,87,12,1,1977,315,13

false,partial effects of the ampakine cx717 in a strain specific battery of tests for manic-like behavior in black swiss mice,"background: ampa receptors are highly expressed throughout the central nervous system and are suggested to be involved in mood regulation. studies found changes in glutamate, its metabolites and receptors in patients with bipolar disorder (bpd) or major depression (md) and in animal models of stress. additional data suggest that the glutamatergic system and ampa receptors specifically, have an important role in modulating the therapeutic effects of mood stabilizers. further research on the role of ampa receptors in mood regulation can be done using ampakines, positive modulators of ampa receptors. ampakines have been studied for cognitive enhancement in neurodegenerative disorders and some were also examined in preclinical studies of mood disorders. in that context, the present study was designed to test the effects of the ampakine cx717 in a strain specific battery of tests for mania-like behaviors.
methods: black swiss male mice were sub-chronically treated with 5 different doses of cx717 or vehicle and tested in a battery of behavioral tests including spontaneous activity, sweet solution preference, resident-intruder, forced swim and amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
results: data show that cx717 doses of 30mg/kg and above, but not lower, reduce activity levels. moreover, 45mg/kg and above reduce interactions in the resident-intruder test and ameliorate amphetamine-induced hyperactivity.
conclusions: the results therefore show a partial effect of cx717 on manic-like behavior, somewhat similar to previously demonstrated effects of atypical antipsychotic drugs in this strain. it is therefore suggested that further work related to ampakines in the treatment of affective disorders might be warranted.",Kara NZ,2015,Pharmacol Rep,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharep.2015.02.008,26398387,Kara NZ; Flaisher-Grinberg S; Einat H,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000374: Aggression; D000661: Amphetamine; D000818: Animals; D018692: Antimanic Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001714: Bipolar Disorder; D000697: Central Nervous System Stimulants; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D007555: Isoxazoles; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D009043: Motor Activity; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D013550: Swimming",,,https://openalex.org/W1991904994,119,20,1,1732,277,11

false,chronic intermittent hypoxia depresses afferent neurotransmission in nts neurons by a reduction in the number of active synapses,"long-term synaptic plasticity has been recently described in brainstem areas associated to visceral afferent sensory integration. chronic intermittent hypoxia (cih), an animal model for studying obstructive sleep apnea in humans, depresses the afferent neurotransmission in nucleus tractus solitarii (nts) neurons, which affect respiratory and autonomic regulation. here we identified the synaptic mechanisms of cih-induced depression of the afferent neurotransmission in nts neurons in juvenile rats. we verified that cih reduced the amplitude of both nmda and non-nmda glutamatergic excitatory currents (eepscs) evoked by tractus solitarii stimulation (ts-eepsc) of second-order neurons in the nts. no changes were observed in release probability, evidenced by absence of any cih-elicited effects on short-term depression and failures in epscs evoked in low calcium. cih also produced no changes in ts-eepsc quantal size, since the amplitudes of both low calcium-evoked epscs and asynchronous ts-eepscs (evoked in the presence of sr 2+ ) were unchanged. using single ts afferent fiber stimulation in slices from control and cih rats we clearly show that cih reduced the quantal content of the ts-eepscs without affecting the quantal size or release probability, suggesting a reduction in the number of active synapses as the mechanism of cih induced ts-eepsc depression. in accordance with this concept, the input–output relationship of stimulus intensity and ts-eepsc amplitude shows an early saturation in cih animals. these findings open new perspectives for a better understanding of the mechanisms underlying the synaptic plasticity in the brainstem sensory neurons under challenges such as those produced by cih in experimental and pathological conditions.",Almado CE,2012,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2654-12.2012,23175827,Almado CE; Machado BH; Leão RM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D003627: Data Interpretation, Statistical; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D002534: Hypoxia, Brain; D008297: Male; D016202: N-Methylaspartate; D009412: Nerve Fibers; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009475: Neurons, Afferent; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D017552: Solitary Nucleus; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2033486767,128,18,1,1764,278,9

false,a pertussis toxin-sensitive 8-lipoxygenase pathway is activated by a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor inaplysianeurons,"acetylcholine (ach) activates two types of chloride conductances in aplysia neurons that can be distinguished by their kinetics and pharmacology. one is a rapidly desensitizing current that is blocked by alpha-conotoxin-imi and the other is a sustained current that is insensitive to the toxin. these currents are differentially expressed in aplysia neurons. we report here that neurons that respond to ach with a sustained chloride conductance also generate 8-lipoxygenase metabolites. the sustained chloride conductance and the activation of 8-lipoxygenase have similar pharmacological profiles. both are stimulated by suberyldicholine and nicotine, and both are inhibited by alpha-bungarotoxin. like the sustained chloride conductance, the activation of 8-lipoxygenase is not blocked by alpha-conotoxin-imi. in spite of the similarities between the metabolic and electrophysiological responses, the generation of 8-lipoxygenase metabolites does not appear to depend on the ion current since an influx of chloride ions is neither necessary nor sufficient for the formation of the lipid metabolites. in addition, the application of pertussis toxin blocked the ach-activated release of arachidonic acid and the subsequent production of 8-lipoxygenase metabolites, yet the ach-induced activation of the chloride conductance is not dependent on a g protein. our results are consistent with the idea that the nicotinic ach receptor that activates the sustained chloride conductance can, independent of the chloride ion influx, initiate lipid messenger synthesis.",Tieman TL,2001,J Neurophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.2001.85.5.2150,11353029,Tieman TL; Steel DJ; Gor Y; Kehoe J; Schwartz JH; Feinmark SJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000109: Acetylcholine; D000818: Animals; D001048: Aplysia; D001091: Arachidonate Lipoxygenases; D001095: Arachidonic Acids; D001115: Arecoline; D001285: Atropine; D002038: Bungarotoxins; D018118: Chloride Channels; D002712: Chlorides; D002794: Choline; D018680: Cholinergic Antagonists; D020916: Conotoxins; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004789: Enzyme Activation; D017952: Ganglia, Invertebrate; D018738: Hexamethonium; D006893: Hydroxyeicosatetraenoic Acids; D015640: Ion Channel Gating; D017136: Ion Transport; D009419: Nerve Tissue Proteins; D009474: Neurons; D009538: Nicotine; D018722: Nicotinic Agonists; D037342: Pertussis Toxin; D020239: Receptor Cross-Talk; D011978: Receptors, Nicotinic; D019789: Tetraethylammonium; D014403: Tubocurarine; D010566: Virulence Factors, Bordetella",,,https://openalex.org/W2330129570,125,21,1,1559,237,10

true,orexinergic signaling mediates light-induced neuronal activation in the dorsal raphe nucleus,"seasonal affective disorder (sad), a major depressive disorder recurring in the fall and winter, is caused by the reduction of light in the environment, and its depressive symptoms can be alleviated by bright light therapy. both circadian and monoaminergic systems have been implicated in the etiology of sad. however, the underlying neural pathways through which light regulates mood are not well understood. the present study utilized a diurnal rodent model, arvicanthis niloticus, to explore the neural pathways mediating the effects of light on brain regions involved in mood regulation. animals kept in constant darkness received light exposure in early subjective day, the time when light therapy is usually applied. the time course of neural activity following light exposure was assessed using fos protein as a marker in the following brain regions/cells: the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn), orexin neurons in the perifornical-lateral hypothalamic area (pf-lha) and the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn). a light-induced increase in fos expression was observed in orexin neurons and the drn, but not in the scn. as the drn is densely innervated by orexinergic inputs, the involvement of orexinergic signaling in mediating the effects of light on the drn was tested in the second experiment. the animals were injected with the selective orexin receptor type 1 (oxr1) antagonist sb-334867 prior to the light exposure. the treatment of sb-334867 significantly inhibited the fos induction in the drn. the results collectively point to the role of orexin neurons in mediating the effects of light on the mood-regulating monoaminergic areas, suggesting an orexinergic pathway that underlies light-dependent mood fluctuation and the beneficial effects of light therapy.",Adidharma W,2012,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.06.020,22710065,Adidharma W; Leach G; Yan L,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.",D000818: Animals; D002940: Circadian Rhythm; D003624: Darkness; D007150: Immunohistochemistry; D047908: Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; D008027: Light; D009434: Neural Pathways; D009474: Neurons; D009479: Neuropeptides; D000068797: Orexins; D010789: Phototherapy; D016760: Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-fos; D011903: Raphe Nuclei; D051381: Rats; D016574: Seasonal Affective Disorder; D015398: Signal Transduction,,,https://openalex.org/W2040770310,92,11,1,1762,298,11
true,blockade of kappa opioid receptors attenuates the development of depressive-like behaviors induced by cocaine withdrawal in rats,"drug dependence is characterized by dysregulation of brain reward systems and increased sensitivity to stress. chronic exposure to drugs of abuse is associated with increased expression of the neuropeptide dynorphin, the endogenous ligand for kappa opioid receptors (kors). activation of kors causes depressive- and aversive-like responses in rodents, raising the possibility that drug-induced upregulation of dynorphin plays a role independence-associated negative states. here we used “binge” exposure to cocaine (3 daily intraperitoneal injections of 15 mg/kg for 14 days) to examine the development of dependence-like behavior in the intracranial self-stimulation (icss) test and the forced swim test (fst). when rats were tested 1 h before their first scheduled injection of each day—a period of drug withdrawal corresponding to 20 h after their last injection on the previous day—there were exposure-dependent increases in icss thresholds (a putative indicator of anhedonia) and decreases in latencies to immobility in the fst (a putative indicator of behavioral despair). administration of the long-lasting kor antagonist norbni (20 μg, intracerebroventricular) before the beginning of the binge regimen attenuated the development of cocaine withdrawal-induced anhedonia in the icss test. in contrast, administration of norbni in the midst of the binge regimen had no effect on expression of cocaine withdrawal-induced anhedonia in the icss test, although it did attenuate despair-like behavior in the fst. these data suggest that blockade of kors before exposure to a stressor (in this case, cocaine withdrawal or forced swimming) can attenuate the development of stress-induced behavioral adaptations. this article is part of a special issue entitled ‘anxiety and depression’.",Chartoff E,2012,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2011.06.014,21736885,Chartoff E; Sawyer A; Rachlin A; Potter D; Pliakas A; Carlezon WA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D003042: Cocaine; D003216: Conditioning, Operant; D003863: Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D018765: Dopamine Uptake Inhibitors; D004333: Drug Administration Routes; D046353: Immobility Response, Tonic; D008297: Male; D009271: Naltrexone; D009292: Narcotic Antagonists; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D011930: Reaction Time; D017473: Receptors, Opioid, kappa; D012055: Reinforcement Schedule; D012646: Self Administration; D013375: Substance Withdrawal Syndrome; D013550: Swimming; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2038357517,128,17,1,1785,291,9
false,extracellular acidosis and high levels of carbon dioxide suppress synaptic transmission and prevent the induction of long-term potentiation in the ca1 region of rat hippocampal slices,"long-term potentiation (ltp) is a long-lasting increase in synaptic strength induced by high frequency stimulation. ltp may participate in learning and memory formation. in many synaptic systems, ltp is dependent on intact function of n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors. nmda receptors may be inhibited in different conditions involving also extracellular acidosis. a decrease in the extracellular ph accompanies many pathological states such as ischemia, hypoxia, and the cns injury. the study was designed to determine whether comparable extracellular acid-base imbalances are able to interfere with the ltp induction. hippocampal slices from adult rats were stimulated with high frequency stimulation (1 x 100 hz/1 s) at schaffer collateral-commissural synaptic system in the environment with different ph (6.7-7.8) and the field responses were recorded in ca1. acidosis was achieved by supplying excessive co2 or by hco3-decrease in standard bicarbonate-containing buffer or by a direct acidification of the buffer containing na-hepes. invariably, all forms of acidification suppressed the efficacy of normal, low frequency synaptic transmission and prevented the induction of ltp in a reversible manner; i.e., after reperfusion of the slices at ph 7.3 and restimulation, there was a return of synaptic transmission back to baseline, and a significant amount of ltp occurred. in contrast, alkalization to ph 7.8, although enhancing synaptic transmission efficacy, did not further increase the ltp magnitude compared to control environment with ph 7.3. the results suggest that extracellular acidosis associated with several pathological conditions in the cns may significantly diminish the ltp induction, and thus negatively affect all physiological processes that utilize ltp.",Velísek L,1998,Hippocampus,https://doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1098-1063(1998)8:1<24::aid-hipo3>3.0.co;2-7,9519884,Velísek L,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000138: Acidosis; D000818: Animals; D001639: Bicarbonates; D002021: Buffers; D002245: Carbon Dioxide; D002555: Cerebrospinal Fluid; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D006624: Hippocampus; D006863: Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D008297: Male; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2055300726,183,26,1,1784,285,11

false,cannabis and adolescent brain development,"heavy cannabis use has been frequently associated with increased rates of mental illness and cognitive impairment, particularly amongst adolescent users. however, the neurobiological processes that underlie these associations are still not well understood. in this review, we discuss the findings of studies examining the acute and chronic effects of cannabis use on the brain, with a particular focus on the impact of commencing use during adolescence. accumulating evidence from both animal and human studies suggests that regular heavy use during this period is associated with more severe and persistent negative outcomes than use during adulthood, suggesting that the adolescent brain may be particularly vulnerable to the effects of cannabis exposure. as the endocannabinoid system plays an important role in brain development, it is plausible that prolonged use during adolescence results in a disruption in the normative neuromaturational processes that occur during this period. we identify synaptic pruning and white matter development as two processes that may be adversely impacted by cannabis exposure during adolescence. potentially, alterations in these processes may underlie the cognitive and emotional deficits that have been associated with regular use commencing during adolescence.",Lubman DI,2015,Pharmacol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pharmthera.2014.11.009,25460036,Lubman DI; Cheetham A; Yücel M,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454: Review",D000293: Adolescent; D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D002186: Cannabinoids; D002188: Cannabis; D003863: Depression; D063388: Endocannabinoids; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007859: Learning Disabilities; D008569: Memory Disorders; D011247: Pregnancy; D011297: Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; D012559: Schizophrenia,,,https://openalex.org/W1985057601,41,5,1,1302,200,7
true,behavioral and biochemical interaction between nicotine and chronic unpredictable mild stress in mice,"nicotine, the main component of tobacco smoke, exerts influence on mood, and contributes to physical and psychological dependence. taking into account frequent concomitance of nicotine abuse and stress, we aimed to research behavioral and biochemical effects associated with nicotine administration in combination with chronic unpredictable mild stress (cums). mice were submitted to the procedure of cums for 4 weeks, 2 h per day. our results revealed that cums-exposed animals exhibited behavioral alteration like anxiety disorders in the elevated plus maze (epm) test, the disturbances in memory in the passive avoidance (pa) test and depressive effects in the forced swim test (fst). moreover, nicotine (0.05-0.5 mg/kg), after an acute or subchronic administration decreased stress-induced depression- and anxiety-like effect as well as memory deficit. administration of metyrapone (50 mg/kg), a glucocorticosteroid antagonist, alleviated the depressive effect induced by the cums. the biochemical experiments showed decreased values of the total antioxidant status (tas), activities of superoxide dismutase (sod) and glutathione peroxidase (gpx) with simultaneously increased in malondialdehyde (mda) concentration in mice submitted to the cums. the same effects were observed after an acute and subchronic nicotine administration within all examined brain structures (i.e., hippocampus, cortex, and cerebellum) and in the whole brain in non-stressed and stressed mice confirming pro-oxidative effect of nicotine. our study contributes to the understanding of behavioral and biochemical mechanisms involved in stress-induced disorders such as depression, anxiety and memory disturbances as well as dual nicotine-stress interactions on the basis of the development of nicotine dependence.",Biala G,2017,Mol Neurobiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-016-9701-0,26780460,Biala G; Pekala K; Boguszewska-Czubara A; Michalak A; Kruk-Slomka M; Budzynska B,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001362: Avoidance Learning; D001921: Brain; D002908: Chronic Disease; D008297: Male; D018782: Maze Learning; D051379: Mice; D009538: Nicotine; D018722: Nicotinic Agonists; D018384: Oxidative Stress; D013315: Stress, Psychological",,,https://openalex.org/W2279256043,101,13,1,1792,292,9
false,a neuronal substrate for a state‐dependent modulation of sensory inputs in the brainstem,"central networks modulate sensory transmission during motor behavior. sensory inputs may thus have distinct impacts according to the state of activity of the central networks. using an in-vitro isolated lamprey brainstem preparation, we investigated whether a brainstem locomotor center, the mesencephalic locomotor region (mlr), modulates sensory transmission. the synaptic responses of brainstem reticulospinal (rs) cells to electrical stimulation of the sensory trigeminal nerve were recorded before and after electrical stimulation of the mlr. the rs cell synaptic responses were significantly reduced by mlr stimulation and the reduction of the response increased with the stimulation intensity of the mlr. bath perfusion of atropine prevented the depression of sensory transmission, indicating that muscarinic receptor activation is involved. previous studies have shown that, upon stimulation of the mlr, behavioral activity switches from a resting state to an active-locomotor state. therefore, our results suggest that a state-dependent modulation of sensory transmission to rs cells occurs in the behavioral context of locomotion and that muscarinic inputs from the mlr are involved.",Le Ray D,2010,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2010.07276.x,20576031,Le Ray D; Juvin L; Boutin T; Auclair F; Dubuc R,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001933: Brain Stem; D004594: Electrophysiology; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D007798: Lampreys; D008124: Locomotion; D009474: Neurons; D011976: Receptors, Muscarinic; D014276: Trigeminal Nerve",,,https://openalex.org/W1902667587,88,13,1,1193,185,8

false,snap-29-mediated modulation of synaptic transmission in culturedhippocampalneurons,"identifying the molecules that regulate both the recycling of synaptic vesicles and the snare components required for fusion is critical for elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying synaptic plasticity. snap-29 was initially isolated as a syntaxin-binding and ubiquitously expressed protein. previous studies have suggested that snap-29 inhibits snare complex disassembly, thereby reducing synaptic transmission in cultured superior cervical ganglion neurons in an activity-dependent manner. however, the role of snap-29 in regulating synaptic vesicle recycling and short-term plasticity in the central nervous system remains unclear. in the present study, we examined the effect of snap-29 on synaptic transmission in cultured hippocampal neurons by dual patch clamp whole-cell recording, fm dye imaging, and immunocytochemistry. our results demonstrated that exogenous expression of snap-29 in presynaptic neurons significantly decreased the efficiency of synaptic transmission after repetitive firing within a few minutes under low and moderate frequency stimulations (0.1 and 1 hz). in contrast, snap-29 did not affect the density of synapses and basal synaptic transmission. whereas neurotransmitter release was unaffected during intensive stimulation, recovery after synaptic depression was impaired by snap-29. furthermore, knockdown of snap-29 expression in neurons by small interfering rna increased the efficiency of synaptic transmission during repetitive firing. these findings suggest that snap-29 acts as a negative modulator for neurotransmitter release, probably by slowing recycling of the snare-based fusion machinery and synaptic vesicle turnover.",Pan PY,2005,J Biol Chem,https://doi.org/10.1074/jbc.m502356200,15890653,Pan PY; Cai Q; Lin L; Lu PH; Duan S; Sheng ZH,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052060: Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D005456: Fluorescent Dyes; D015870: Gene Expression; D006624: Hippocampus; D006801: Humans; D009474: Neurons; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D011726: Pyridinium Compounds; D050766: Qb-SNARE Proteins; D050767: Qc-SNARE Proteins; D000644: Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; D034741: RNA, Small Interfering; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D050600: SNARE Proteins; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013572: Synaptic Vesicles; D033921: Vesicular Transport Proteins",,,https://openalex.org/W2039166461,82,7,1,1673,243,10

true,regular moderate or intense exercise prevents depression-like behavior without change of hippocampal tryptophan content in chronically tryptophan-deficient and stressed mice,"regular exercise has an antidepressant effect in human subjects. studies using animals have suggested that the antidepressant effect of exercise is attributable to an increase of brain 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht); however, the precise mechanism underlying the antidepressant action via exercise is unclear. in contrast, the effect of 5-ht on antidepressant activity has not been clarified, in part because the therapeutic response to antidepressant drugs has a time lag in spite of the rapid increase of brain 5-ht upon administration of these drugs. this study was designed to investigate the contribution of brain 5-ht to the antidepressant effect of exercise. mice were fed a tryptophan-deficient diet and stressed using chronic unpredictable stress (cus) for 4 weeks with or without the performance of either moderate or intense exercise on a treadmill 3 days per week. the findings demonstrated that the onset of depression-like behavior is attributable not to chronic reduction of 5-ht but to chronic stress. regular exercise, whether moderate or intense, prevents depression-like behavior with an improvement of adult hippocampal cell proliferation and survival and without the recovery of 5-ht. concomitantly, the mice that exercised showed increased hippocampal noradrenaline. regular exercise prevents the impairment of not long-term memory but short-term memory in a 5-ht-reduced state. together, these findings suggest that: (1) chronic reduction of brain 5-ht may not contribute to the onset of depression-like behavior; (2) regular exercise, whether moderate or intense, prevents the onset of chronic stress-induced depression-like behavior independent of brain 5-ht and dependent on brain adrenaline; and (3) regular exercise prevents chronic tryptophan reduction-induced impairment of not long-term but short-term memory.",Lee H,2013,PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0066996,23861751,Lee H; Ohno M; Ohta S; Mikami T,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001362: Avoidance Learning; D001923: Brain Chemistry; D049109: Cell Proliferation; D003863: Depression; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D057567: Memory, Long-Term; D008570: Memory, Short-Term; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009638: Norepinephrine; D010805: Physical Conditioning, Animal; D051381: Rats; D012701: Serotonin; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D014364: Tryptophan",,,https://openalex.org/W2027762080,173,20,1,1836,295,10

false,plasticity in serotonin control mechanisms in the gut,"5-hydroxytryptamine (5-ht or serotonin) is a charged molecule and must be transported across biological membranes. enzymes that catabolize 5-ht are all intracellular; therefore, 5-ht inactivation requires a high affinity transporter, known as serotonin transporter (sert or 5-htt). in the central and enteric nervous systems, sert is located in serotonergic neurons; however, these neurons are not present in the gastrointestinal mucosa, where 5-ht initiates peristaltic and secretory reflexes. instead, sert is expressed by enterocytes. the severity of gastrointestinal effects caused by drugs that inhibit sert, such as tricyclic antidepressants, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cocaine, does not usually prevent their therapeutic or recreational use because backup transporters and alterations in receptor gene expression allow the gut to adapt, albeit imperfectly, to their toxicity.",Gershon MD,2003,Curr Opin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.coph.2003.07.005,14644011,Gershon MD,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.; D016454: Review",D000818: Animals; D001692: Biological Transport; D002352: Carrier Proteins; D017615: Enteric Nervous System; D004759: Enterochromaffin Cells; D020895: Enterocytes; D041981: Gastrointestinal Tract; D008562: Membrane Glycoproteins; D026901: Membrane Transport Proteins; D009419: Nerve Tissue Proteins; D012701: Serotonin; D050486: Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins,,,https://openalex.org/W2091279184,53,8,1,899,144,5

false,anoxia on slow inward currents of immature hippocampal neurons,"1. the effects of brief anoxia (2-4 min) on membrane currents--especially the tetrodotoxin (ttx)-insensitive, cd2+-sensitive slow inward currents, presumed to be ca2+ currents--were studied by single-electrode voltage clamp in ca1 and ca3 neurons in submerged hippocampal slices from adult and newborn wistar rats (pn1-13). 2. in mature neurons, anoxia had no effect on q-type inward relaxations, but slowly activating c-type outward currents were depressed. the most striking change was the suppression of ca inward currents (especially the slowly inactivating l-type, by greater than 95%). this effect of anoxia was not sensitive to the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor blocker, d-aminophosphonovalerate. anoxia also reversibly abolished the nmda-evoked inward current. 3. in neurons from newborn animals (pn1-6), q-type inward relaxations and postanoxic outward currents were very small or undetectable. the slow inward (ca) currents were smaller than in mature cells, but they showed a clearer separation between low-threshold, fast-inactivating and high-threshold, slowly inactivating currents. both types of current were more resistant to anoxia (mean depression of l-type was by only 53.3 +/- 5.6%, mean +/- se). 4. in such immature neurons, the nmda-evoked inward currents were also more resistant to anoxia. 5. by pn7-13, increasing maturation was reflected in 1) larger voltage-dependent inward currents, 2) increasingly evident q-type relaxations and postanoxic outward currents, and 3) near-complete blockade of inward currents by anoxia (at pn11-13, mean depression of l-type currents was by 98.5 +/- 1.5%).",Krnjević K,1989,J Neurophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.1989.62.4.896,2553881,Krnjević K; Cherubini E; Ben-Ari Y,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000375: Aging; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D001224: Aspartic Acid; D015220: Calcium Channels; D004553: Electric Conductivity; D006624: Hippocampus; D000860: Hypoxia; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D016202: N-Methylaspartate; D009474: Neurons; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains",,,https://openalex.org/W2432480032,62,9,1,1624,290,15

true,antidepressant effect of taurine in diabetic rats,"clinical and preclinical studies have shown that diabetic individuals present more depressive behaviors than non-diabetic individuals. taurine, one of the most abundant free amino acids in the central nervous system, modulates a variety of biological functions and acts as an agonist at gabaa receptors. our objective was to assess the antidepressant effect of taurine in diabetic rats. additionally, we studied the effect of taurine on weight gain, water and food intake, and blood glucose levels in diabetic and non-diabetic rats. male wistar rats were divided into control (ctr) and streptozotocin-induced diabetic (stz) groups and were administered daily 0, 25, 50 or 100 mg/kg of taurine (n = 10 per subgroup) intraperitoneally. after 28 days of treatment, the animals were exposed to the forced swimming test, and their behaviors were recorded. weight gain, water and food intake, and blood glucose levels were measured weekly. our results showed that stz rats had a higher immobility duration than ctr rats, and taurine decreased this depressive-like behavior in stz rats at doses of 25 and 100 mg/kg. both of these doses of taurine also decreased water intake and improved weight gain in stz rats. all doses of taurine decreased the water intake in ctr rats. taurine, at a dose of 100 mg/kg, decreased food intake and blood glucose levels in stz rats. because taurine is a gaba agonist and both amino acids are lower in the plasma of diabetic and depressive individuals, we hypothesize that taurine may represent a new adjuvant drug for the treatment of depression in diabetic individuals.",Caletti G,2012,Amino Acids,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00726-012-1226-x,22302366,Caletti G; Olguins DB; Pedrollo EF; Barros HM; Gomez R,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001835: Body Weight; D003863: Depression; D003921: Diabetes Mellitus, Experimental; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004326: Drinking; D004435: Eating; D006801: Humans; D007274: Injections, Intraperitoneal; D008297: Male; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013311: Streptozocin; D013550: Swimming; D013654: Taurine",,,https://openalex.org/W2068528307,49,7,1,1597,289,12

false,metabolic preconditioning of mammalian cells: mimetic agents for hypoxia lack fidelity in promoting phosphorylation of pyruvate dehydrogenase,"induction of hif-1α by oxygen limitation promotes increased phosphorylation and catalytic depression of mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase (pdh) and an enhanced glycolytic poise in cells. cobalt chloride and desferrioxamine are widely used as mimics for hypoxia because they increase the levels of hif-1α. we evaluated the ability of these agents to elicit selected physiological responses to hypoxia as a means to metabolically precondition mammalian cells, but without the detrimental effects of hypoxia. we show that, while cocl2 does increase hif-1α in a dose-dependent manner, it unexpectedly and strikingly decreases pdh phosphorylation at e1α sites 1, 2, and 3 (ser293, ser300, and ser232, respectively) in hepg2 cells. this same effect is also observed for site 1 in mouse nih/3t3 fibroblasts and j774 macrophages. cocl2 unexpectedly decreases the mrna expression for pdh kinase-2 in hepg2 cells, which likely explains the dephosphorylation of pdh observed. and nor does desferrioxamine promote the expected increase in pdh phosphorylation. dimethyloxaloylglycine (a prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor) performs better in this regard, but failed to promote the stronger effects seen with hypoxia. consequently, cocl2 and desferrioxamine are unreliable mimics of hypoxia for physiological events downstream of hif-1α stabilization. our study demonstrates that mimetic chemicals must be chosen with caution and evaluated thoroughly if bona fide cellular outcomes are to be promoted with fidelity.",Borcar A,2013,Cell Tissue Res,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00441-012-1517-2,23138570,Borcar A; Menze MA; Toner M; Hand SC,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000600: Amino Acids, Dicarboxylic; D000818: Animals; D015153: Blotting, Western; D015687: Cell Hypoxia; D002460: Cell Line; D003035: Cobalt; D003676: Deferoxamine; D015971: Gene Expression Regulation, Enzymologic; D006801: Humans; D051795: Hypoxia-Inducible Factor 1, alpha Subunit; D008322: Mammals; D051379: Mice; D010766: Phosphorylation; D011768: Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex; D012333: RNA, Messenger",,,https://openalex.org/W2085588291,141,18,1,1498,240,10

false,gabaa receptor kinetics in the cerebellar nuclei: evidence for detection of transmitter from distant release sites,"neurons of the cerebellar nuclei receive gabaergic input from purkinje cells. purkinje boutons have several closely spaced presynaptic densities without gaba transporters, raising the possibility that neurotransmitter released by one presynaptic site diffuses to multiple postsynaptic sites. to test whether such local spillover may contribute to transmission, we studied gating of gaba(a) receptors at 31-33 degrees c in cerebellar nuclear neurons acutely dissociated from mice. currents were evoked by rapid application of long steps, brief pulses, and high-frequency trains of gaba to outside-out patches. receptors desensitized and deactivated rapidly, and dose-response measurements estimated an ec(50) of approximately 30 microm. from these data, a kinetic scheme was developed that replicated the recorded currents. next, we simulated diffusion of gaba in the synaptic cleft, constrained by previous electron microscopic data, and drove the kinetic gaba(a) receptor model with modeled concentration transients. simulations predicted receptor occupancies of approximately 100% directly opposite the release site and approximately 50% at distant postsynaptic densities, such that receptors up to 700 nm from a release site opened on the timescale of the inhibitory postsynaptic currents before desensitizing. further simulations of probabilistic release from multiple-site boutons suggested that local spillover-mediated transmission slows the onset and limits the extent of depression during high-frequency signaling.",Pugh JR,2005,Biophys J,https://doi.org/10.1529/biophysj.104.055814,15626699,Pugh JR; Raman IM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D002529: Cerebellar Nuclei; D003198: Computer Simulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D007700: Kinetics; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D008959: Models, Neurological; D009474: Neurons; D018377: Neurotransmitter Agents; D011963: Receptors, GABA-A; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D005680: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W1973561961,114,17,1,1523,235,9
true,concomitant use of tramadol and venlafaxine – evaluation of antidepressant-like activity and other behavioral effects in rats,"background: the aim of this study was to evaluate antidepressant-like effect (porsolt test), locomotor activity and motor coordination of joint administration of tramadol (trm) and venlafaxine (ven) in rats.
methods: the tests were performed on male wistar rats after single and chronic treatment (7 and 14 days) with trm intraperitoneally (ip) and ven orally (po) administered once a day. the controls were given 0.5% carboxymethylcellulose (cmc) solution (0.5 ml per rat, ip and po).
results: it was found that combination of trm (5 mg/kg ip) with ven (20 mg/kg po) caused an increased antidepressant effect compared to trm and ven administered alone, with no effect on locomotor activity or motor coordination in rats, which may be of clinical significance. it was also observed that reduced time of active swimming of animals in porsolt test with an increased dose (10 and 20 mg/kg) and time of administration (7 and 14 days) of trm were correlated with a decreased locomotor activity in rats. it may indicate the development of tolerance to trm's antidepressant effect in rats during chronic treatment with doses higher than 5 mg/kg.

false,role of mitochondrial electron transport complex i in coenzyme q1reduction by intact pulmonary arterial endothelial cells and the effect of hyperoxia,"the objective was to determine the impact of intact normoxic and hyperoxia-exposed (95% o 2 for 48 h) bovine pulmonary arterial endothelial cells in culture on the redox status of the coenzyme q 10 homolog coenzyme q 1 (coq 1 ). when coq 1 (50 μm) was incubated with the cells for 30 min, its concentration in the medium decreased over time, reaching a lower level for normoxic than hyperoxia-exposed cells. the decreases in coq 1 concentration were associated with generation of coq 1 hydroquinone (coq 1 h 2 ), wherein 3.4 times more coq 1 h 2 was produced in the normoxic than hyperoxia-exposed cell medium (8.2 ± 0.3 and 2.4 ± 0.4 μm, means ± se, respectively) after 30 min. the maximum coq 1 reduction rate for the hyperoxia-exposed cells, measured using the cell membrane-impermeant redox indicator potassium ferricyanide, was about one-half that of normoxic cells (11.4 and 24.1 nmol·min −1 ·mg −1 cell protein, respectively). the mitochondrial electron transport complex i inhibitor rotenone decreased the coq 1 reduction rate by 85% in the normoxic cells and 44% in the hyperoxia-exposed cells. there was little or no inhibitory effect of nad(p)h:quinone oxidoreductase 1 (nqo1) inhibitors on coq 1 reduction. intact cell oxygen consumption rates and complex i activities in mitochondria-enriched fractions were also lower for hyperoxia-exposed than normoxic cells. the implication is that intact pulmonary endothelial cells influence the redox status of coq 1 via complex i-mediated reduction to coq 1 h 2 , which appears in the extracellular medium, and that the hyperoxic exposure decreases the overall coq 1 reduction capacity via a depression in complex i activity.",Merker MP,2007,Am J Physiol Lung Cell Mol Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajplung.00448.2006,17601793,Merker MP; Audi SH; Lindemer BJ; Krenz GS; Bongard RD,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000332: Aerobiosis; D000818: Animals; D016227: Benzoquinones; D002417: Cattle; D002470: Cell Survival; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D002851: Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; D003470: Culture Media; D042967: Electron Transport Complex I; D042783: Endothelial Cells; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D005292: Ferricyanides; D018496: Hyperoxia; D007770: L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; D008928: Mitochondria; D010084: Oxidation-Reduction; D010101: Oxygen Consumption; D011651: Pulmonary Artery; D013053: Spectrophotometry; D014048: Tolonium Chloride; D014451: Ubiquinone",,,https://openalex.org/W2140741042,160,29,1,1679,309,8
false,selective cholinergic immunolesioning affects synaptic plasticity in developing visual cortex,"cholinergic neurotransmission is known to affect activity-dependent plasticity in various areas, including the visual cortex. however, relatively little is known about the exact role of subcortical cholinergic inputs in the regulation of plastic events in this region during early postnatal development. in the present study, synaptic transmission and plasticity in the developing visual cortex were studied following selective immunotoxic removal of the basal forebrain cholinergic afferents in 4-day-old rat pups. the lesion produced dramatic cholinergic neuronal and terminal fibre loss associated with decreased mrna levels for the m1 and m2 muscarinic receptors, as well as clear-cut impairments of long-term potentiation (ltp) in visual cortex slices. indeed, after theta burst stimulation of layer iv a long-term depression (ltd) instead of an ltp was induced in immunolesioned slices. this functional change appears to be due to the lack of cholinergic input as exogenous application of acetylcholine prevented the shift from ltp to ltd. in addition, lesioned rats showed an increased sensitivity to acetylcholine (ach). while application of 20 microm ach produced a depression of the field potential in immunolesioned rat slices, in order to observe the same effect in control slices we had to increase ach concentration to up to 200 microm. taken together, our results indicate that deprivation of cholinergic input affects synaptic transmission and plasticity in developing visual cortex, suggesting that the cholinergic system could play an active role in the refinement of the cortical circuitry during maturation.",Kuczewski N,2005,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2005.04014.x,15869476,Kuczewski N; Aztiria E; Leanza G; Domenici L,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000109: Acetylcholine; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D000911: Antibodies, Monoclonal; D002795: Choline O-Acetyltransferase; D018678: Cholinergic Agents; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D022062: Electrophysiologic Techniques, Cardiac; D005260: Female; D006624: Hippocampus; D000922: Immunotoxins; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008297: Male; D009699: N-Glycosyl Hydrolases; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009474: Neurons; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D011976: Receptors, Muscarinic; D020133: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; D054789: Ribosome Inactivating Proteins, Type 1; D000076985: Saporins; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D014793: Visual Cortex",,,https://openalex.org/W2146893133,93,10,1,1627,262,9

false,neurogranin/rc3 enhances long-term potentiation and learning by promoting calcium-mediated signaling,"in neurons, neurogranin (ng) binds calmodulin (cam), and its binding affinity is reduced by increasing ca 2+ , phosphorylation by pkc, or oxidation by oxidants. ng concentration in the hippocampus of adult mice varied broadly (ng +/+ , ∼160-370 and ng +/- , ∼70-230 pmol/mg); the level in ng +/+ mice is one of the highest among all neuronal cam-binding proteins. among ng +/- mice, but less apparent in ng +/+ , a significant relationship existed between their hippocampal levels of ng and performances in the morris water maze. ng -/- mice performed poorly in this task; they also displayed deficits in high-frequency-induced long-term potentiation (ltp) in area ca1 of hippocampal slices, whereas low-frequency-induced long-term depression was enhanced. thus, compared with ng +/+ mice, the frequency-response curve of ng -/- shifted to the right. paired-pulse facilitation and synaptic fatigue during prolonged stimulation at 10 hz (900 pulses) were unchanged in ng -/- slices, indicating their normal presynaptic function. measurements of ca 2+ transients in ca1 pyramidal neurons after weak and strong tetanic stimulations (100 hz, 400 and 1000 msec, respectively) revealed a significantly greater intracellular ca 2+ ([ca 2+ ] i ) response in ng +/+ compared with ng -/- mice, but the decay time constants did not differ. the diminished ca 2+ dynamics in ng -/- mice are a likely cause of their decreased propensity to undergo ltp. thus, ng may promote a high [ca 2+ ] i by a “mass-action” mechanism; namely, the higher the ng concentration, the more ng-cam complexes will be formed, which effectively raises [ca 2+ ] i at any given ca 2+ influx. this mechanism provides potent signal amplification in enhancing synaptic plasticity as well as learning and memory.",Huang KP,2004,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.2213-04.2004,15564582,Huang KP; Huang FL; Jäger T; Li J; Reymann KG; Balschun D,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D020013: Calcium Signaling; D002148: Calmodulin-Binding Proteins; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D006624: Hippocampus; D007858: Learning; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D051379: Mice; D018345: Mice, Knockout; D009419: Nerve Tissue Proteins; D051579: Neurogranin; D013037: Spatial Behavior",,,https://openalex.org/W2041165019,100,10,1,1770,331,10
false,compensatory proteome adjustments imply tissue-specific structural and metabolic reorganization following episodic hypoxia or anoxia in the epaulette shark (hemiscyllium ocellatum),"the epaulette shark ( hemiscyllium ocellatum ) represents an ancestral vertebrate model of episodic hypoxia and anoxia tolerance at tropical temperatures. we used two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches, combined with a suite of physiological measures, to characterize this species' responses to 1) one episode of anoxia plus normoxic recovery, 2) one episode of severe hypoxia plus recovery, or 3) two episodes of severe hypoxia plus recovery. we examined these responses in the cerebellum and rectal gland, two tissues with high atp requirements. sharks maintained plasma ionic homeostasis following all treatments, and activities of na + /k + -atpase and caspase 3/7 in both tissues were unchanged. oxygen lack and reoxygenation elicited subtle adjustments in the proteome. hypoxia led to more extensive proteome responses than anoxia in both tissues. the cerebellum and rectal gland exhibited treatment-specific responses to oxygen limitation consistent with one or more of several strategies: 1) neurotransmitter and receptor downregulation in cerebellum to prevent excitotoxicity, 2) cytoskeletal/membrane reorganization, 3) metabolic reorganization and more efficient intracellular energy shuttling that are more consistent with sustained atp turnover than with long-term metabolic depression, 4) detoxification of metabolic byproducts and oxidative stress in light of continued metabolic activity, particularly following hypoxia in rectal gland, and 5) activation of prosurvival signaling. we hypothesize that neuronal morphological changes facilitate prolonged protection from excitotoxicity via dendritic spine remodeling in cerebellum (i.e., synaptic structural plasticity). these results recapitulate several highly conserved themes in the anoxia and hypoxia tolerance, preconditioning, and oxidative stress literature in a single system. in addition, several of the identified pathways and proteins suggest potentially novel mechanisms for enhancing anoxia or hypoxia tolerance in vertebrates. overall, our data show that episodic hypoxic or anoxic exposure and recovery in the epaulette shark amplifies a constitutive suite of compensatory mechanisms that further prepares them for subsequent insults.",Dowd WW,2010,Physiol Genomics,https://doi.org/10.1152/physiolgenomics.00176.2009,20371547,Dowd WW; Renshaw GM; Cech JJ; Kültz D,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000222: Adaptation, Physiological; D000818: Animals; D001786: Blood Glucose; D001921: Brain; D002531: Cerebellum; D004573: Electrolytes; D015180: Electrophoresis, Gel, Two-Dimensional; D000860: Hypoxia; D007773: Lactates; D013058: Mass Spectrometry; D020543: Proteome; D040901: Proteomics; D012123: Pulmonary Ventilation; D012018: Reflex; D012491: Salt Gland; D012754: Sharks; D000254: Sodium-Potassium-Exchanging ATPase",,,https://openalex.org/W2118248265,180,22,1,2261,344,11

false,chronic inhibition of mammalian target of rapamycin by rapamycin modulates cognitive and non-cognitive components of behavior throughout lifespan in mice,"aging is, by far, the greatest risk factor for most neurodegenerative diseases. in non-diseased conditions, normal aging can also be associated with declines in cognitive function that significantly affect quality of life in the elderly. it was recently shown that inhibition of mammalian tor (mtor) activity in mice by chronic rapamycin treatment extends lifespan, possibly by delaying aging {harrison, 2009 #4}{miller, 2011 #168}. to explore the effect of chronic rapamycin treatment on normal brain aging we determined cognitive and non-cognitive components of behavior throughout lifespan in male and female c57bl/6 mice that were fed control- or rapamycin-supplemented chow. our studies show that rapamycin enhances cognitive function in young adult mice and blocks age-associated cognitive decline in older animals. in addition, mice fed with rapamycin-supplemented chow showed decreased anxiety and depressive-like behavior at all ages tested. levels of three major monoamines (norepinephrine, dopamine and 5-hydroxytryptamine) and their metabolites (3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homovanillic acid, and 5-hydroxyindolacetic acid) were significantly augmented in midbrain of rapamycin-treated mice compared to controls. our results suggest that chronic, partial inhibition of mtor by oral rapamycin enhances learning and memory in young adults, maintains memory in old c57bl/6j mice, and has concomitant anxiolytic and antidepressant-like effects, possibly by stimulating major monoamine pathways in brain.",Halloran J,2012,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.06.054,22750207,Halloran J; Hussong SA; Burbank R; Podlutskaya N; Fischer KE; Sloane LB; Austad SN; Strong R; Richardson A; Hart MJ; Galvan V,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000375: Aging; D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D001362: Avoidance Learning; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D015306: Biogenic Monoamines; D001921: Brain; D003072: Cognition Disorders; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D005260: Female; D005786: Gene Expression Regulation; D019417: Hindlimb Suspension; D007166: Immunosuppressive Agents; D008297: Male; D018782: Maze Learning; D008568: Memory; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D012737: Sex Factors; D020123: Sirolimus; D058570: TOR Serine-Threonine Kinases; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W1987487278,153,20,1,1515,240,8

false,activation of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors induces long‐term potentiation in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus,"the present study was conducted to clarify the role of nicotinic ach receptors (nachrs) on long-term potentiation (ltp) in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus using extracellular recording techniques. intraperitoneal application of nicotine at a dose of 3.0 mg/kg but not 0.03 or 0.3 mg/kg produced a gradually developing, long-lasting increase for 120 min similar to tetanic ltp. nicotine at a dose of 9. 0 mg/kg caused a temporary increase followed by depression. the long-lasting potentiation induced by nicotine at 3.0 mg/kg, which was named nicotinic long-term potentiation (ltpn), and tetanic ltp were significantly suppressed by pretreatment with mecamylamine (0.5 mg/kg i.p.), a nonselective nicotinic antagonist, but not affected by postapplication of mecamylamine. interestingly, choline, a selective alpha7 nachr agonist, at 3.0-90 mg/kg, induced the long-lasting potentiation similar to ltpn in a dose-dependent manner in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus. the long-lasting potentiation induced by choline (30 mg/kg i.p.) was additionally increased by postapplication of nicotine (3.0 mg/kg i.p.) or tetanic stimulation. the present study revealed that systemic application of nicotine or choline induced the long-lasting potentiation in vivo in the intact mouse dentate gyrus, suggesting that alpha7 nachrs may contribute to the induction of ltp by nicotine, and supporting in vivo animal studies that nicotine improves learning and memory performance.",Matsuyama S,2000,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1460-9568.2000.00259.x,11029644,Matsuyama S; Matsumoto A; Enomoto T; Nishizaki T,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000109: Acetylcholine; D000818: Animals; D002794: Choline; D018891: Dentate Gyrus; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D008464: Mecamylamine; D008568: Memory; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009474: Neurons; D009538: Nicotine; D011978: Receptors, Nicotinic; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D014029: Tobacco Use Disorder; D064569: alpha7 Nicotinic Acetylcholine Receptor",,,https://openalex.org/W2031254878,120,16,1,1473,248,11
false,single and multiple vesicle fusion induce different rates of endocytosis at a central synapse,"during synaptic transmission, neurotransmitter-laden vesicles fuse with the presynaptic membrane and discharge their contents into the synaptic cleft. after fusion, the vesicular membrane is retrieved by endocytosis for reuse. this recycling mechanism ensures a constant supply of releasable vesicles at the nerve terminal. the kinetics of endocytosis have been measured mostly after intense or non-physiological stimulation. here we use capacitance measurements to resolve the fusion and retrieval of single and multiple vesicles following mild physiological stimulation at a mammalian central synapse. the time constant of endocytosis after single vesicle fusion was 56 ms; after a single action potential or trains at < or = 2 hz it was about 115 ms, but increased gradually to tens of seconds as the frequency and the number of action potentials increased. these results indicate that an increase in the rate of exocytosis at the active zone induces a decrease in the rate of endocytosis. existing models, including inhibition of endocytosis by ca(2+), could not account for these results our results suggest that an accumulation of unretrieved vesicles at the plasma membrane slows endocytosis. these findings may resolve the debate about the dependence of endocytosis kinetics on the stimulation frequency, and suggest a potential role of regulation of endocytosis in short-term synaptic depression.",Sun JY,2002,Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/417555a,12037569,Sun JY; Wu XS; Wu LG,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D001933: Brain Stem; D002118: Calcium; D025802: Electric Capacitance; D004705: Endocytosis; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D005089: Exocytosis; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007700: Kinetics; D008561: Membrane Fusion; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D022142: Secretory Vesicles; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2036402923,93,14,1,1405,228,9
false,calcium reverses global and regional myocardial dysfunction caused by the combination of verapamil and halothane,"in order to evaluate the effects of the combination of halothane and verapamil on left ventricular function and coronary blood flow (cbf), six sheep were anaesthetized with halothane (1.2% inspired) and given increasing cumulative doses of intravenous verapamil. regional myocardial function was assessed by sonomicrometry in the areas supplied by the left anterior descending coronary artery (lad) and the left circumflex coronary artery (lc). changes in global haemodynamics, atrioventricular conduction, lv relaxation and systolic shortening after 0.32 mg x kg-1 intravenous verapamil indicated impaired left ventricular function. significant myocardial dysfunction (post-systolic shortening) occurred in the lad territory, accompanied by a 64% decrease (42 +/- 6 to 15 +/- 3, p less than 0.01) in coronary perfusion pressure (cpp). coronary blood flow in the lc segment decreased 83% (102 +/- 15 to 17 +/- 13, p less than 0.01) as coronary reserve was exhausted with the decrease in cpp. calcium chloride reversed the impairment of global and regional myocardial function observed with verapamil, improved the impaired left ventricular relaxation, but did not significantly alter atrioventricular conduction. thus the combination halothane-verapamil can cause significant left ventricular depression and myocardial dysfunction, possibly by inducing subendocardial ischaemia or by direct pharmacologic effect. calcium chloride reverses this regional myocardial dysfunction as well as the deleterious global haemodynamic changes caused by halothane-verapamil; however, the changes in atrioventricular conduction are not corrected by calcium.",Lehot JJ,1987,Acta Anaesthesiol Scand,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1399-6576.1987.tb02599.x,3630588,Lehot JJ; Leone BJ; Foëx P,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000818: Animals; D002122: Calcium Chloride; D009202: Cardiomyopathies; D003326: Coronary Circulation; D006221: Halothane; D006321: Heart; D006439: Hemodynamics; D012756: Sheep; D014700: Verapamil,,,https://openalex.org/W2032200898,112,15,1,1643,265,8

false,spreading depression and reverberatory seizures induce the upregulation of mrna for glial fibrillary acidic protein,"the present study evaluates the relative roles of seizure activity and spreading depression in upregulating glial fibrillary acidic protein (gfap) mrna expression. stimulating electrodes were placed bilaterally in the angular bundle, and recording electrodes were placed bilaterally in the dentate gyrus of adult rats. intense electrographic seizures were induced by delivering stimulus trains through one stimulating electrode. in some cases, spreading depression accompanied the seizures, while in other cases the seizures occured in the absence of spreading depression. animals were killed 24 h following the last stimulus train, and the forebrains were prepared for quantitative in situ hybridization. seizure activity and spreading depression led to significant increases in gfap mrna levels in the hippocampal formation. seizure activity alone (without spreading depression) induced a 4-fold increase in gfap mrna levels in the hilus and molecular layer of the dentate gyrus and in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus. when seizure activity was accompanied by spreading depression, there was a 10-fold increase in gfap mrna levels in these same regions. regional differences within the hippocampal formation in glial cell response were evident. while gfap mrna levels in stratum lacunosum-moleculare of the hippocampus were upregulated by seizure activity and spreading depression, levels in hippocampal stratum radiatum of the hippocampus remained unchanged. the results suggest that abnormal neuronal activity can influence glial cell gene expression and that spreading depression is a stronger signal than seizure activity in upregulating gfap mrna levels.",Bonthius DJ,1994,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(94)91654-3,8062084,Bonthius DJ; Stringer JL; Lothman EW; Steward O,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D013181: Cortical Spreading Depression; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005904: Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; D006624: Hippocampus; D017403: In Situ Hybridization; D008297: Male; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D012640: Seizures",,,https://openalex.org/W1985513636,115,15,1,1677,257,11
true,an hdac-dependent epigenetic mechanism that enhances the efficacy of the antidepressant drug fluoxetine,"depression is a prevalent and debilitating psychiatric illnesses. however, currently prescribed antidepressant drugs are only efficacious in a limited group of patients. studies on balb/c mice suggested that histone deacetylase (hdac) inhibition may enhance the efficacy of the widely-prescribed antidepressant drug fluoxetine. this study shows that reducing hdac activity in fluoxetine-treated balb/c mice leads to robust antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. while reducing the activity of class i hdacs 1 and 3 led to antidepressant effects, additional class ii hdac inhibition was necessary to exert anxiolytic effects. in fluoxetine-treated mice, hdac inhibitors increased enrichment of acetylated histone h4 protein and rna polymerase ii at promotor 3 of the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) gene and increased bdnf transcription from this promotor. reducing bdnf-stimulated tropomyosin kinase b receptor activation in fluoxetine-treated mice with low hdac activity abolished the behavioral effects of fluoxetine, suggesting that the hdac-triggered epigenetic stimulation of bdnf expression is critical for therapeutic efficacy.",Schmauss C,2015,Sci Rep,https://doi.org/10.1038/srep08171,25639887,Schmauss C,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000818: Animals; D014151: Anti-Anxiety Agents; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D019208: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; D047369: Chromatin Immunoprecipitation; D044127: Epigenesis, Genetic; D005260: Female; D005473: Fluoxetine; D056572: Histone Deacetylase Inhibitors; D006655: Histone Deacetylases; D006657: Histones; D008297: Male; D008562: Membrane Glycoproteins; D051379: Mice; D008807: Mice, Inbred BALB C; D011401: Promoter Regions, Genetic; D011505: Protein-Tyrosine Kinases; D012319: RNA Polymerase II; D020813: Receptor, trkB; D014158: Transcription, Genetic",,,https://openalex.org/W2076125629,103,13,1,1143,168,7

false,"sodium butyrate, an epigenetic interventional strategy, attenuates a stress-induced alteration of mk-801's pharmacologic action","twenty-four hours after mice are exposed to a single session of forced swimming in cold water, the ability of mk-801 (dizocilpine), a noncompetitive nmda receptor antagonist, to antagonize electrically precipitated seizures is reduced. conceivably, this reduction in mk-801's antiseizure efficacy reflects a stress-induced alteration in nmda receptor-mediated neurotransmission due to changes in gene expression 24 h after a single stress. recently, epigenetic interventional strategies impacting expression of genes whose regulation is controlled by the acetylation status of histone proteins in the nucleosome, an octomeric complex of histone proteins and promoter regions of double-stranded dna, have been tested in preclinical models of various neuropsychiatric disorders, including huntington disease and major depression. these strategies have been studied extensively in cancer biology. in the current investigation, the severity of the stress-induced reduction of mk-801's ability to raise the threshold voltage for the elicitation of tonic hindlimb extension was reduced when sodium butyrate (1.5 g/kg, ip) was administered around the time of stress. prior research showed that this dose of sodium butyrate reliably increased the acetylation status of h3 and h4 histone proteins in the hippocampus and cerebral cortex of mice. thus, the attenuation of the stress-induced reduction of mk-801's antiseizure efficacy may be due to the increased acetylation of histone proteins in the nucleosomal core and promotion of gene expression. these data encourage development of epigenetic strategies to prevent some of the deleterious consequences of stress.",Deutsch SI,2008,Eur Neuropsychopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.euroneuro.2007.11.004,18164185,Deutsch SI; Rosse RB; Long KD; Gaskins BL; Burket JA; Mastropaolo J,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D002087: Butyrates; D016291: Dizocilpine Maleate; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004597: Electroshock; D004827: Epilepsy; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D018696: Neuroprotective Agents; D013315: Stress, Psychological",,,https://openalex.org/W2164105353,127,17,1,1657,259,8

false,antidepressant administration modulates neural stem cell survival and serotoninergic differentiation through bcl-2,"the hippocampus has long been associated with learning, memory, and modulation of emotional responses. previous studies demonstrated that stress-induced loss of hippocampal neurons may contribute to the pathogenesis of depression. the recent observations supported that antidepressant drugs increase the production of serotoninergic neurotransmitter and they play a critical role in the initiation of neurogenesis in the hippocampus. in order to explore the possible new mechanism of the treatment of depression, we cultured neural stem cells (nscs) derived from the hippocampus of adult rats as an in vitro model to evaluate the capabilities of neuroprotection and neural differentiation in nscs by fluoxetine (fl) treatment. our results showed that 20 microm fl treatment can significantly increase the proliferation rate of nscs (p<0.05), and up-regulate the mrna and protein expressions of bcl-2 in day-7 fl-treated nscs (p<0.01). using bcl-2 gene silencing with small interfering rna, our data verified that fl can prevent fas ligand-induced caspase-dependent apoptosis in nscs through the activation of bcl-2. the in vitro observation and immunofluorescent study further demonstrated that fl treatment can stimulate the neurite development and serotoninergic differentiation of nscs through the activation of bcl-2. using microdialysis with high performance liquid chromatography- electrochemical detection, the functional release of serotonin in the differentiating nscs with fl treatment was increased and simultaneously regulated by the bcl-2 expressions. in sum, the study results indicate that antidepressant administration can increase nscs survival, promote the neurite development, and facilitate nscs differentiating into the functional serotoninergic neurons via the modulation of bcl-2 expression.",Chen SJ,2007,Curr Neurovasc Res,https://doi.org/10.2174/156720207779940707,17311541,Chen SJ; Kao CL; Chang YL; Yen CJ; Shui JW; Chien CS; Chen IL; Tsai TH; Ku HH; Chiou SH,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D053687: Adult Stem Cells; D000818: Animals; D018687: Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; D017209: Apoptosis; D015153: Blotting, Western; D020169: Caspases; D002454: Cell Differentiation; D002470: Cell Survival; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D002851: Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; D004797: Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay; D005473: Fluoxetine; D006624: Hippocampus; D020287: In Situ Nick-End Labeling; D016501: Neurites; D009474: Neurons; D019253: Proto-Oncogene Proteins c-bcl-2; D034622: RNA Interference; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D020133: Reverse Transcriptase Polymerase Chain Reaction; D012701: Serotonin",,,https://openalex.org/W2104287765,114,12,1,1814,279,9
false,potassium-induced changes in excitability in the hippocampal ca1 region of immature and adult rats,"orthodromic and spontaneous population spike activity was measured in vitro in the ca1 region of rat hippocampal slices to determine maturational differences in excitability and susceptibility to k(+)-induced seizures. several indices of excitability in the ca1 region changed in a non-monotonic fashion during maturation, in response to step-wise increases in bath [k+]. slices from rats 18-22 days old, showed a greater probability of both spontaneous epileptiform activity and episodes of seizure-like activity followed by spreading depression, and more prolonged durations of evoked seizure-like events. elevation of [k+] in the bathing medium increased these indices in a similar manner in older rats but not to the same degree as in 18- to 22-day-old rats. however, the threshold level of bath [k+] resulting in evoked bursts of population spikes was lower in adult and 28- to 32-day-old rats than in 18- to 22-day-old rats, suggesting that excitability is not uniformly greater at any given age. in 10- to 15-day-old rats, elevation of bath [k+] either produced persistent blockade of population responses, or increased the amplitude of the initial population spike, without producing bursts. basal levels of [k+] in the interstitium of the slices corresponded to the various levels of [k+] placed in the bathing medium and there were no differences among age groups. therefore, differences in basal [k+]o cannot account for the maturational changes in excitability and seizure activity. the period from 18-22 days of age in the rat is a useful focal point for investigating mechanisms underlying maturational changes in propensity to develop seizures.",Kreisman NR,1993,Brain Res Dev Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/0165-3806(93)90123-r,8306432,Kreisman NR; Smith ML,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D006624: Hippocampus; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D011188: Potassium; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D012640: Seizures",,,https://openalex.org/W2065024312,98,14,1,1659,291,9
false,sex-related effects of an immune challenge on growth and begging behavior of barn swallow nestlings,"parent-offspring conflicts lead the offspring to evolve reliable signals of individual quality, including parasite burden, which may allow parents to adaptively modulate investment in the progeny. sex-related variation in offspring reproductive value, however, may entail differential investment in sons and daughters. here, we experimentally manipulated offspring condition in the barn swallow (hirundo rustica) by subjecting nestlings to an immune challenge (injection with bacterial lipopolysaccharide, lps) that simulates a bacterial infection, and assessed the effects on growth, feather quality, expression of morphological (gape coloration) and behavioral (posture) begging displays involved in parent-offspring communication, as well as on food allocation by parents. compared to sham-injected controls, lps-treated chicks suffered a depression of body mass and a reduction of palate color saturation. in addition, lps treatment resulted in lower feather quality, with an increase in the occurrence of fault bars on wing feathers. the color of beak flanges, feather growth and the intensity of postural begging were affected by lps treatment only in females, suggesting that chicks of either sex are differently susceptible to the immune challenge. however, irrespective of the effects of lps, parents equally allocated food among control and challenged offspring both under normal food provisioning and after a short period of food deprivation of the chicks. these results indicate that bacterial infection and the associated immune response entail different costs to offspring of either sex, but a decrease in nestling conditions does not affect parental care allocation, possibly because the barn swallow adopts a brood-survival strategy. finally, we showed that physiological stress induced by pathogens impairs plumage quality, a previously neglected major negative impact of bacterial infection which could severely affect fitness, particularly among long-distance migratory birds.",Romano A,2011,PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0022805,21818393,Romano A; Rubolini D; Caprioli M; Boncoraglio G; Ambrosini R; Saino N,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000818: Animals; D005241: Feathers; D005247: Feeding Behavior; D005260: Female; D005508: Food Deprivation; D007109: Immunity; D008070: Lipopolysaccharides; D008297: Male; D009055: Mouth; D009425: Nesting Behavior; D010858: Pigmentation; D012727: Sex Characteristics; D046388: Swallows; D015430: Weight Gain,,,https://openalex.org/W2036539531,99,15,1,1995,316,9

true,influence of sex and estrous cycle on the effects of acute tryptophan depletion induced by a gelatin-based mixture in adult wistar rats,"women are more vulnerable to develop depression and anxiety disorders than men. this may be related to higher serotonergic vulnerability in women. serotonergic vulnerability entails that differences between people in the regulation of serotonin (5-ht) determine the vulnerability of an individual to develop depression or other 5-ht-related disorders. the aim of the present experiment was to evaluate whether male and female wistar rats differ in serotonergic vulnerability. here, a stronger behavioral response to acute tryptophan (trp) depletion was assumed to reflect serotonergic vulnerability. twenty-four male and 48 female rats were repeatedly subjected to treatment with a gelatin-based protein–carbohydrate mixture, either with or without l-tryptophan. female estrous cycle phase was determined by means of vaginal smears and the females were divided into two groups based on their estrous cycle phase: pro-estrus/estrus and met-estrus/di-estrus. blood samples showed stronger trp depletion in males than females. there was no effect of estrous cycle on plasma trp concentrations. in contrast, treatment effects on some brain trp concentrations were influenced by estrous cycle phase, females in pro-estrus/estrus showed the strongest response to trp depletion. in the open field test and home cage emergence test, females in pro-estrus/estrus also showed the strongest behavioral response to acute trp depletion. in general, females showed more activity than males in anxiety-related situations and this effect appeared to be enhanced by trp depletion. in the social interaction test, passive body contact in males and females in pro-estrus/estrus was decreased after trp depletion whereas it was increased in females in the met-estrus/di-estrus phase. acute trp depletion affected object recognition, but did not affect behavior in the forced swimming test and a reaction time task. it is concluded that sex and estrous cycle phase can influence the behavioral response to trp depletion, and that females in pro-estrus/estrus show the strongest behavioral response to acute trp depletion.",Jans LA,2007,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2007.04.028,17531394,Jans LA; Lieben CK; Blokland A,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000596: Amino Acids; D000818: Animals; D001007: Anxiety; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D001923: Brain Chemistry; D003863: Depression; D030762: Estrous Cycle; D005260: Female; D005780: Gelatin; D007398: Interpersonal Relations; D008297: Male; D009043: Motor Activity; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D011930: Reaction Time; D021641: Recognition, Psychology; D012701: Serotonin; D012727: Sex Characteristics; D013550: Swimming; D014364: Tryptophan",,,https://openalex.org/W1988279428,135,22,1,2100,332,15
true,effects in animal models of depression of lisuride alone and upon co-administration with antidepressants.,"effects of lisuride, a central dopamine and serotonin agonist of the ergot type, in animal models of depression were investigated in comparison with those of desipramine, mianserin and rolipram. lisuride, like desipramine and mianserin, inhibited reserpine-induced hypothermia in mice (0.5-5.0 mg/kg, i.p.) and suppressed muricide in olfactory bulbectomized rats (ed50 = 0.16 mg/kg, i.p.) in a dose-dependent manner. the anti-muricidal effect was slightly enhanced by the repeated administration of 0.25 mg/kg lisuride. lisuride (0.05-0.25 mg/kg, i.p.), like desipramine, dose-dependently reduced the duration of immobility in rats forced to swim, and this effect was antagonized by haloperidol. the reduction of immobility time was enhanced by the repeated administration of lisuride; at the same time, the ambulation in rats increased. furthermore, the immobility-reducing effects of desipramine and rolipram were markedly enhanced by the co-administration of a low dose of lisuride (0.025 mg/kg, i.p.), which by itself had no effect on the immobility time. these results indicate that lisuride may be useful for the treatment of depression and indicate that a low dose of lisuride may enhance the clinical effectiveness of antidepressants such as desipramine.",Nakamura K,1989,Nihon Yakurigaku Zasshi,https://doi.org/10.1254/fpj.94.81,2792964,Nakamura K; Ikoma Y; Kimura K; Nakada Y; Kobayashi S; Yamaguchi M; Nakagawa H,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D004740: English Abstract; D016428: Journal Article,"D000378: Agonistic Behavior; D000818: Animals; D001831: Body Temperature; D003863: Depression; D003891: Desipramine; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004357: Drug Synergism; D004359: Drug Therapy, Combination; D004873: Ergolines; D008090: Lisuride; D051379: Mice; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains",,,https://openalex.org/W1966295021,105,15,1,1262,217,11
false,in silico methods to identify meat-derived prolyl endopeptidase inhibitors,"according to the world health organization (who), approximately 450 million people suffer from mental or neurological disorders and five of the ten leading causes of disability and premature death worldwide are psychiatric conditions. social, biological and neurological sciences provided extensive understanding into the role of risk and protective factors in the development of mental disorders and poor mental health. altered activity of a number of enzymes, such as prolyl endopeptidase (pep, ec 3.4.21.26), has been linked to the prevention and treatment of a number of mental disorders, including anxiety, depression and alzheimer's disease. the inhibition of pep has potential for use in the prevention and in the treatment of mental disorders. the objective of this work was to identify pep-inhibitory peptides from meat proteins using in silico methods. in this paper, five proteins commonly found in meat by-products were evaluated as a substrate for use in the generation of pep inhibitory peptides. these include serum albumin, collagen and myosin. these proteins were cleaved in silico using biopep and expasy peptidecutter and the generated peptides were compared to known pep-inhibiting peptides in the database of biopep. a number of novel pep inhibitory peptide sequences were identified in this study, including ppl, apph, ipp and ppg with corresponding ic50 values of 2.86, 3.95, 4.02 and 2.70 mm, respectively. this work demonstrates the usefulness of in silico analysis for predicting the release of pep-inhibiting peptides from meat proteins.",Lafarga T,2015,Food Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.foodchem.2014.11.150,25577089,Lafarga T; O'Connor P; Hayes M,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000595: Amino Acid Sequence; D000818: Animals; D006801: Humans; D008460: Meat; D008969: Molecular Sequence Data; D000085822: Prolyl Oligopeptidases; D012697: Serine Endopeptidases; D015842: Serine Proteinase Inhibitors,,,https://openalex.org/W1985306294,74,9,1,1564,265,10

false,bioelectrical and mechanical effects of tiapamil (ro 11-1781) on isolated guinea pig myocardium,"in isolated electrically stimulated guinea pig papillary muscles tiapamil exerts a negative inotropic action that corresponds to its presumptive inhibitory effects on the slow-channel-mediated transmembrane ca2+ influx. however, contractile depression is always accompanied by marked alterations of the normal na+-carried action potential. thus na+-dependent upstroke velocity (dv/dtmax) declines while the length of the plateau phase increases. these observations indicate that tiapamil, besides inhibiting ca2+ inflow, also interferes with the fast inward na+ current and possibly also reduces the repolarising k+ efflux. after partial depolarisation with a k+ -rich tyrode solution (19 mmol·litre−1 k+). tiapamil lowers the ca2+-dependent contractile force as it reduces the bioelectric parameters (upstroke velocity, amplitude, duration) of the ca2+-mediated action potentials. moreover, in partially depolarised myocardium, the mg2+-induced bioelectric membrane activity is suppressed by tiapamil. tiapamil probably operates as an agent with mixed na+-, k+-, ca2+- and mg2+-antagonistic effects and, in this respect, differs considerably from the more specific ca2+antagonists such as verapamil, d 600 (gallopamil), nifedipine (and other 1,4-dihydropyridines) or diltiazem. however, tiapamil by virtue of its combined damping actions on both transmembrane na+and ca2+ conductivities (together with prolongation of the action potential plateau), is a drug which exerts, simultaneously, the fundamental myocardial membrane effects of antiarrhythmic agents of group i, iii and iv, according to the classification of singh and vaughan williams. thus these bioelectrical observations are in accordance with the results of clinical studies on tiapamil, which have demonstrated directly its antiarrhythmic efficacy.",Späh F,1986,Cardiovasc Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/20.1.42,3708640,Späh F,article,D016428: Journal Article,D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D006168: Guinea Pigs; D006321: Heart; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D011437: Propylamines; D013976: Tiapamil Hydrochloride,,,https://openalex.org/W2037441629,95,15,1,1813,281,10

false,frequency-dependent effects of calcium antagonists on atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness: demonstration and characterization in anesthetized dogs.,"calcium-channel blockers are known to affect slow inward current in a frequency-dependent fashion. the purpose of these experiments was to study use-dependent effects of verapamil, diltiazem, and nifedipine on atrioventricular conduction in vivo. loading and maintenance infusion techniques were developed to study each drug at a series of stable plasma concentrations in autonomically blocked dogs anesthetized with morphine and alpha-chloralose. all three agents produced changes in atrioventricular conduction and refractoriness that increased with increasing stimulation frequency. the time dependence of drug-induced changes in atrioventricular conduction was characterized both by varying the coupling of single test stimuli and by abruptly changing activation frequency. the time constants for onset of (tau on) and recovery from (tau off) block were typical for each drug, with nifedipine having a faster time constant (tau off = 0.36 +/- 0.12 sec) than verapamil (tau off = 3.2 +/- 1.0 sec, tau on = 28 +/- 8 sec) or diltiazem (tau off = 2.7 +/- 1.2 sec, tau on = 13 +/- 4 sec). the time constants for each drug were independent of concentration but the magnitude of time-dependent change increased with increasing drug concentration. we conclude that calcium-channel blockers have important frequency-dependent effects on atrioventricular conduction in vivo. this frequency dependence may result in selective depression of atrioventricular conduction in the presence of supraventricular tachyarrhythmias, with important potential implications for the clinical use of these agents.",Talajic M,1986,Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.74.5.1156,3769173,Talajic M; Nattel S,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001283: Atrioventricular Node; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D004110: Diltiazem; D004285: Dogs; D005260: Female; D006329: Heart Conduction System; D006339: Heart Rate; D008297: Male; D009543: Nifedipine; D012032: Refractory Period, Electrophysiological; D014700: Verapamil",,,https://openalex.org/W2019155640,158,18,1,1590,255,9
false,use-dependent facilitation and depression of ?-type ca2+ current in guinea-pig ventricular myocytes: modulation by ca2+ and isoprenaline,"an increase in stimulation frequency can facilitate or depress cardiac ca2+ current (ica). the aim was to examine the ca2+ dependence of these effects, to determine if facilitation is sustained, and to elucidate the mechanism by which isoprenaline modulates facilitation.we examined the effects of increasing the stimulation frequency for 1 min, from 0.05 to 1 hz, on ica recorded from guinea-pig ventricular myocytes, using the whole-cell, voltage-clamp technique.1 hz stimulation caused a facilitation of ica that peaked in 5 s and was followed by depression towards the basal level. metabolic inhibitors or replacement of extracellular ca2+ with ba2+ abolished facilitation without affecting depression, implying that they are independent processes and that facilitation required atp and ca2+. subtraction of the depression observed in either condition, from the response to 1 hz stimulation recorded under control conditions, revealed that ica facilitation was well maintained during 1 hz stimulation. increased intracellular ca2+ buffering reduced both phases of the response. furthermore, varying the extracellular ca2+ concentration ([ca2+]o) revealed a ca(2+)-dependent enhancement of depression and a bell-shaped dependence of facilitation on [ca2+]o. facilitation increased with [ca2+]o up to 1 mm, then declined at higher concentrations due to partial masking by the overlaping depression. isoprenaline produced concentration-dependent inhibition of facilitation and enhancement of depression when pipettes contained 2 mm egta, but not bapta. for an equivalent increase in ica amplitude, the effects of isoprenaline and elevated [ca2+]o on the response to 1 hz stimulation were quantitatively the same.facilitation is sustained during increased activity, but appears transient due to overlapping depression. both responses are promoted by increased submembrane [ca2+]. isoprenaline appears to modulate facilitation and depression as a consequence of increased ca2+ influx, rather than camp-dependent phosphorylation. the apparent block of facilitation by isoprenaline may result from masking by the enhanced depression.",Bates SE,1999,Cardiovasc Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0008-6363(99)00216-3,10690314,Bates SE; Gurney AM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D001464: Barium; D002118: Calcium; D002120: Calcium Channel Agonists; D020746: Calcium Channels, L-Type; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005110: Extracellular Space; D006168: Guinea Pigs; D007545: Isoproterenol; D008297: Male; D009206: Myocardium; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D012519: Sarcoplasmic Reticulum; D018709: Statistics, Nonparametric",,,https://openalex.org/W2076189407,136,19,1,2130,343,11
false,ventrolateral origin of each cycle of rhythmic activity generated by the spinal cord of the chick embryo,"the mechanisms responsible for generating rhythmic motor activity in the developing spinal cord of the chick embryo are poorly understood. here we investigate whether the activity of motoneurons occurs before other neuronal populations at the beginning of each cycle of rhythmic discharge.the spatiotemporal organization of neural activity in transverse slices of the lumbosacral cord of the chick embryo (e8-e11) was investigated using intrinsic and voltage-sensitive dye (vsd) imaging. vsd signals accompanying episodes of activity comprised a rhythmic decrease in light transmission that corresponded to each cycle of electrical activity recorded from the ipsilateral ventral root. the rhythmic signals were widely synchronized across the cord face, and the largest signal amplitude was in the ventrolateral region where motoneurons are located. in unstained slices we recorded two classes of intrinsic signal. in the first, an episode of rhythmic activity was accompanied by a slow decrease in light transmission that peaked in the dorsal horn and decayed dorsoventrally. superimposed on this signal was a much smaller rhythmic increase in transmission that was coincident with each cycle of discharge and whose amplitude and spatial distribution was similar to that of the vsd signals. at the onset of a spontaneously occurring episode and each subsequent cycle, both the intrinsic and vsd signals originated within the lateral motor column and spread medially and then dorsally. by contrast, following a dorsal root stimulus, the optical signals originated within the dorsal horn and traveled ventrally to reach the lateral motor column.these findings suggest that motoneuron activity contributes to the initiation of each cycle of rhythmic activity, and that motoneuron and/or r-interneuron synapses are a plausible site for the activity-dependent synaptic depression that modeling studies have identified as a critical mechanism for cycling within an episode.",Arai Y,2007,PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0000417,17479162,Arai Y; Mentis GZ; Wu JY; O'Donovan MJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural",D000818: Animals; D002642: Chick Embryo; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D013116: Spinal Cord; D013126: Spinal Nerve Roots,,,https://openalex.org/W2152305075,104,17,1,1967,306,9

false,introgression patterns in the mosaic hybrid zone between mytilus edulis and m. galloprovincialis,"abstract hybrid zones are fascinating systems to investigate the structure of genetic barriers. marine hybrid zones deserve more investigation because of the generally high dispersion potential of planktonic larvae which allows migration on scales unrivalled by terrestrial species. here we analyse the genetic structure of the mosaic hybrid zone between the marine mussels mytilus edulis and m. galloprovincialis , using three length‐polymorphic pcr loci as neutral and diagnostic markers on 32 samples along the atlantic coast of europe. instead of a single genetic gradient from m. galloprovincialis on the iberian peninsula to m. edulis populations in the north sea, three successive transitions were observed in france. from south to north, the frequency of alleles typical of m. galloprovincialis first decreases in the southern bay of biscay, remains low in charente, then increases in south brittany, remains high in most of brittany, and finally decreases again in south normandy. the two enclosed patches observed in the midst of the mosaic hybrid zone in charente and brittany, although predominantly m. edulis ‐like and m. galloprovincialis ‐like, respectively, are genetically original in two respects. first, considering only the various alleles typical of one species, the patches show differentiated frequencies compared to the reference external populations. second, each patch is partly introgressed by alleles of the other species. when introgression is taken into account, linkage disequilibria appear close to their maximum possible values, indicating a strong genetic barrier within all transition zones. some pre‐ or postzygotic isolation mechanisms (habitat specialization, spawning asynchrony, assortative fertilization and hybrid depression) have been documented in previous studies, although their relative importance remains to be evaluated. we also provided evidence for a recent migratory ‘short‐cut’ connecting m. edulis ‐like populations of the charente patch to an external m. edulis population in normandy and thought to reflect artificial transfer of spat for aquaculture.",Bierne N,2003,Mol Ecol,https://doi.org/10.1046/j.1365-294x.2003.01730.x,12535095,Bierne N; Borsa P; Daguin C; Jollivet D; Viard F; Bonhomme F; David P,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000483: Alleles; D025041: Animal Migration; D000818: Animals; D001267: Atlantic Ocean; D049872: Bivalvia; D002678: Chimera; D005602: France; D014644: Genetic Variation; D005828: Genetics, Population; D007438: Introns; D016013: Likelihood Functions; D015810: Linkage Disequilibrium; D013045: Species Specificity",,,https://openalex.org/W2101733503,110,26,2,2107,335,11
false,ethanol and pentobarbital inhibition of intrasynaptosomal sequestration of calcium,"synaptic membranes sequester calcium by a nonmitochondrial, atp-dependent mechanism. this process appears to be important in maintaining low intrasynaptosomal levels of ionized calcium. in vitro addition of ethanol or pentobarbital to synaptic membranes isolated from mouse brain inhibited this atp-dependent calcium uptake. ethanol inhibited the uptake in a concentration-dependent manner over the range of 50–1600 mm. the inhibitory effects of low concentrations of ethanol were enhanced by a reduction in the ionized calcium concentration. the effects of even the highest concentration of ethanol were completely reversed when the drug was removed from the membranes. the effects of ethanol and pentobarbital were temperature dependent. the drugs produced a significant inhibition of uptake at assay temperatures of 23–37°, but not at assay temperatures of 1–18°. a single injection of ethanol inhibited the atp-dependent sequestration of calcium and reduced the sensitivity of the isolated membranes to in vitro ethanol exposure, which suggests the development of an acute tolerance. compared with membranes from control mice, membranes from mice that were chronically ingesting ethanol accumulated less calcium and were tolerant to the in vitro effects of ethanol and pentobarbital. these results suggest that the known stimulatory effects of ethanol and pentobarbital on the resting release of neurotransmitters, and the development of tolerance to these effects, may be due to alterations in the intrasynaptosomal sequestration of calcium.",Harris RA,1981,Biochem Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-2952(81)90520-7,7317104,Harris RA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D000431: Ethanol; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D010424: Pentobarbital; D013574: Synaptosomes; D013696: Temperature",,,https://openalex.org/W2160728464,82,9,1,1546,238,11

false,increased levels of nmda receptor nr2a subunits at pre‐ and postsynaptic sites of the hippocampal ca1: an early response to conditional double knockout of presenilin 1 and 2,"greater than 90% of familial alzheimer's disease (ad) is linked to mutations of presenilin (ps), and the loss of ps function altogether within mouse brains by conditional double knockout of the ps 1 and 2 genes (ps-cdko) leads to age-dependent emergence of ad phenotypes, including neurodegeneration and reduced synaptic plasticity in the hippocampal ca1. the goal of our study was to identify the ultrastructural and molecular changes at synapses in the hippocampal ca1 of this ps-cdko mouse model of ad. we examined the asymmetric (excitatory) synapses formed on apical dendrites of ca1 pyramidal neurons at 2 months postnatal, an age when ad-like symptoms emerge but brain morphology, as assessed by light microscopy, is still normal. our quantitative electron microscopic analyses confirm that ps-cdko hippocampi at 2 months postnatal do not yet exhibit synapse losses or spine size alterations. however, immunocytochemistry reveals that the same region exhibits a 28% increase in the proportion of spines labeled for the nr2a subunits of nmda receptors (nmdar), with a 31% increase specifically at postsynaptic densities and a concomitant reduction of these subunits at nonsynaptic sites within spine heads. in contrast, no change in levels or the distribution pattern of nr2b subunit levels were detected within spine heads. presynaptically, nr2a levels are elevated at axo-spinous junctions and these may contribute to the timing-dependent, long-term depression. these observations point to an early-onset trapping of nmdar at synapses that are subtle but may underlie the reduced synaptic plasticity at 2 months of age and excitotoxicity at later stages.",Aoki C,2009,J Comp Neurol,https://doi.org/10.1002/cne.22151,19795494,Aoki C; Lee J; Nedelescu H; Ahmed T; Ho A; Shen J,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D056547: CA1 Region, Hippocampal; D054732: Calcium-Calmodulin-Dependent Protein Kinase Type 2; D003712: Dendrites; D005786: Gene Expression Regulation; D051379: Mice; D018345: Mice, Knockout; D016253: Microscopy, Immunoelectron; D008954: Models, Biological; D053764: Presenilin-1; D053766: Presenilin-2; D017729: Presynaptic Terminals; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D013569: Synapses",,,https://openalex.org/W2161435099,173,29,1,1662,283,8
true,search for biological correlates of depression and mechanisms of action of antidepressant treatment modalities. do neuropeptides play a role?,"dysregulation of the monoaminergic systems is likely a sufficient but not a necessary cause of depression. a wealth of data indicates that neuropeptides, e.g., npy, crh, somatostatin, tachykinins and cgrp play a role in affective disorders and alcohol use/abuse. this paper focuses on npy in etiology and pathophysiology of depression. decreased peptide and mrna npy were found in hippocampus of both the genetic, e.g., the fsl strain, and environmental rat models of depression, e.g., chronic mild stress and early life maternal separation paradigms. rat models of alcoholism also show altered npy. furthermore, npy is also reduced in csf of depressed patients. antidepressive treatments tested so far (lithium, topiramate, ssris, ect and ecs, wheel running) increase npy selectively in rat hippocampus and in human csf. moreover, npy given icv to rat has antidepressive effects which are antagonized by npy-y1 blockers. the data support our hypothesis that the npy system dysregulation constitutes one of the biological underpinnings of depression and that one common mechanism of action of antidepressive treatment modalities may be effects on npy and its receptors. in a novel paradigm, early life maternal separation was superimposed on “depressed” fsl and control rats and behavioral and brain neurochemistry changes observed in adulthood. the consequences were more deleterious in genetically vulnerable fsl. early antidepressive treatment modulated the adult sequelae. consequently, if these data are confirmed, the ethical and medical question that will be asked is whether it is permissible and advisable to consider prophylactically treating persons at risk.",Mathé AA,2007,Physiol Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2007.05.016,17572454,Mathé AA; Husum H; El Khoury A; Jiménez-Vasquez P; Gruber SH; Wörtwein G; Nikisch G; Baumann P; Agren H; Andersson W; Södergren A; Angelucci F,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004565: Electroconvulsive Therapy; D005632: Fructose; D006624: Hippocampus; D006801: Humans; D018020: Lithium Compounds; D008426: Maternal Deprivation; D009478: Neuropeptide Y; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D012931: Social Environment; D000077236: Topiramate",,,https://openalex.org/W2049481489,141,21,2,1669,282,13

false,hippocampal leptin suppresses methamphetamine‐induced hyperlocomotion,"leptin is an anorexigenic peptide which is synthesized in white adipose tissue. the actions of leptin are mediated by the leptin receptor which is abundantly localized in the hypothalamus and is involved in energy regulation and balance. recently, there has been evidence suggesting that the leptin receptor is also present in the hippocampus and may be involved with hippocampal excitability and long-term depression. to investigate the physiological function of leptin signalling in the hippocampus, we studied the effects of leptin on methamphetamine-induced ambulatory hyperactivity by utilizing intra-hippocampal infusion (i.h.) in mice. our results show that the infusion of leptin (5 ng each bilaterally i.h.) does not affect the basal ambulatory activity but significantly suppresses methamphetamine-induced ambulatory hyperactivity as compared to saline-infused controls. interestingly, higher dose of leptin increases the suppression of the methamphetamine-induced ambulatory hyperactivity. the i.h. infusion of leptin did not activate the jak-stat pathway, which is the cellular signalling pathway through which leptin acts in the hypothalamus. the infusion of leptin also did not affect activation of p42/44 mapk which is known to be another leptin-induced signalling pathway in the brain. these results demonstrate that leptin has a novel potential suppressive effect on methamphetamine-induced hyperlocomotion and also suggest that there must be an alternative pathway in the hippocampus through which leptin signalling is being mediated.",Nishio M,2010,Basic Clin Pharmacol Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1742-7843.2010.00591.x,20486923,Nishio M; Watanabe Y,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004789: Enzyme Activation; D006624: Hippocampus; D006948: Hyperkinesis; D053612: Janus Kinases; D020738: Leptin; D008694: Methamphetamine; D051379: Mice; D008815: Mice, Inbred Strains; D019950: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 1; D048052: Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase 3; D054411: Receptors, Leptin; D050791: STAT Transcription Factors; D015398: Signal Transduction",,,https://openalex.org/W1845625660,69,5,1,1552,237,12

false,application of an optogenetic byway for perturbing neuronal activity via glial photostimulation,"dynamic activity of glia has repeatedly been demonstrated, but if such activity is independent from neuronal activity, glia would not have any role in the information processing in the brain or in the generation of animal behavior. evidence for neurons communicating with glia is solid, but the signaling pathway leading back from glial-to-neuronal activity was often difficult to study. here, we introduced a transgenic mouse line in which channelrhodopsin-2, a light-gated cation channel, was expressed in astrocytes. selective photostimulation of these astrocytes in vivo triggered neuronal activation. using slice preparations, we show that glial photostimulation leads to release of glutamate, which was sufficient to activate ampa receptors on purkinje cells and to induce long-term depression of parallel fiber-to-purkinje cell synapses through activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors. in contrast to neuronal synaptic vesicular release, glial activation likely causes preferential activation of extrasynaptic receptors that appose glial membrane. finally, we show that neuronal activation by glial stimulation can lead to perturbation of cerebellar modulated motor behavior. these findings demonstrate that glia can modulate the tone of neuronal activity and behavior. this animal model is expected to be a potentially powerful approach to study the role of glia in brain function.",Sasaki T,2012,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1213458109,23185019,Sasaki T; Beppu K; Tanaka KF; Fukazawa Y; Shigemoto R; Matsui K,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001253: Astrocytes; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D000075402: Channelrhodopsins; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D051379: Mice; D008822: Mice, Transgenic; D009434: Neural Pathways; D009457: Neuroglia; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D062308: Optogenetics; D010775: Photic Stimulation; D011689: Purkinje Cells; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2125798946,95,12,1,1396,217,9

true,knockout mice in understanding the mechanism of action of lithium,"lithium inhibits impase (inositol monophosphatase) activity, as well as inositol transporter function. to determine whether one or more of these mechanisms might underlie lithium's behavioural effects, we studied impa1 (encoding impase) and smit1 (sodium-myo-inositol transporter 1)-knockout mice. in brains of adult homozygous impa1-knockout mice, impase activity was found to be decreased; however, inositol levels were not found to be altered. behavioural analysis indicated decreased immobility in the forced-swim test as well as a strongly increased sensitivity to pilocarpine-induced seizures. these are behaviours robustly induced by lithium. in homozygous smit1-knockout mice, free inositol levels were decreased in the frontal cortex and hippocampus. these animals behave like lithium-treated animals in the model of pilocarpine seizures and in the porsolt forced-swim test model of depression. in contrast with o'brien et al.

[(125) i]galanin receptor binding in the piriform cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala was found to be significantly down-regulated. these data show that the galanin system is regulated by repeated ecs in a number of brain regions implicated in seizure regulation and depression. these changes may play a role in the therapeutic effect of ecs.",Christiansen SH,2010,J Neurosci Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.22517,20936701,Christiansen SH; Woldbye DP,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D003863: Depression; D004565: Electroconvulsive Therapy; D004597: Electroshock; D019004: Galanin; D005786: Gene Expression Regulation; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D012640: Seizures; D014018: Tissue Distribution,,,https://openalex.org/W2110734921,79,11,1,1541,262,10

false,"a male-biased natal sex-ratio in inbred collared lemmings, dicrostonyx groenlandicus","a captive colony of collared lemmings (dicrostonyx groenlandicus) from northern alaska produced a male-biased sex ratio of 67% males for about three generations. these lemmings have a pair of autosomes fused to the sex chromosomes. thus, males have two copies of some (formerly autosomal) sex-linked genes: one set is x-linked; the other can be described as y-linked. given such a karyotype, deleterious recessive alleles on the autosomal portion of the x chromosome are more resistant to selection than truly autosomal loci because they can be eliminated by homozygosity only in females. the male-bias could have resulted from one or more lethals carried on the formerly autosomal arm of the x chromosome. as inbreeding coefficients approached 0.3, the lethal was apparently homozygous in half of the homogametic (female) zygotes. this phenomenon may explain the excess of males and xy females attributed to meiotic drive in dicrostonyx torquatus from siberia. if under the natural mating system, inbreeding depression limits fitness, then fusion of autosomal chromatin to the sex chromosomes could be an adaptation to reduce inbreeding depression in heterogametic individuals.",Jarrell GH,1995,Hereditas,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1601-5223.1995.00031.x,8598343,Jarrell GH,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000222: Adaptation, Physiological; D000413: Alaska; D000818: Animals; D003411: Arvicolinae; D002871: Chromosome Banding; D005260: Female; D007178: Inbreeding; D007621: Karyotyping; D008297: Male; D008540: Meiosis; D012744: Sex Ratio; D012800: Siberia; D014960: X Chromosome; D014998: Y Chromosome",,,https://openalex.org/W2039339596,84,11,1,1178,200,8
false,control of interval‐force relation in canine ventricular myocardium studied with ryanodine,"the mechanism of post‐extrasystolic, rest and frequency potentiation was studied in canine isolated ventricular muscle. ryanodine, which impairs ca availability from the sarcoplasmic reticulum (sr), reduced the amplitude of the extrasystole less than that of the steady state contraction. ryanodine also inhibited post‐extrasystolic potentiation and converted rest‐potentiation into rest depression. rest‐potentiation was blocked preferentially by ryanodine compared to post‐extrasystolic potentiation. an increase in the contribution of extracellular ca to the extrasystolic contraction could not entirely account for the post‐extrasystolic potentiation. prolonged rest, by itself, also caused depression of the first post‐rest contraction. during rest‐potentiation, sr ca seemed to play a greater role in contraction than transmembrane ca influx. however, the ability of the ‘release pool’ of ca in the sr to be reprimed after a contraction was reduced. this was seen as a decrease in post‐extrasystolic potentiation elicited immediately after rest. a decrease in stimulus interval was associated with a transient decrease in contraction amplitude followed by an increase. an abrupt increase in stimulus interval had the opposite effect. ryanodine blocked the initial transient changes and accelerated the delayed changes. these results suggest that the transient changes in contraction after sudden changes in drive interval are dependent on the sr. transmembrane ca entry and the rate of recovery of the ca release process (repriming) in the sr after a contraction seem to be interval‐dependent. the data also indicate that different mechanisms are involved in post‐extrasystolic and rest‐potentiation. the results are consistent with a model which proposes ‘recirculation’ of activator ca within the sr after a contraction or of the presence of an appreciable amount of inactivation of the sr ca release process during normal stimulation. an increased pool of releasable ca due to longer recirculation time or a time‐dependent decay in the level of inactivation of ca release from the sr may give rise to rest‐potentiation.",Bose D,1988,Br J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1988.tb11709.x,2463029,Bose D; Hryshko LV; King BW; Chau T,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000470: Alkaloids; D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D005117: Cardiac Complexes, Premature; D004285: Dogs; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D012433: Ryanodine",,,https://openalex.org/W2169769810,90,11,1,2128,337,16

false,adrenergic and serotoninergic control of growth hormone secretion in adult male rats1,"plasma radioimmunoassayable growth hormone (gh) levels measured in adult male rats anesthetized for 2 hr with urethane, were found to be lower and strikingly more uniform than those of animals decapitated while awake. rats prepared in this manner, and bearing a cannula chronically implanted in a lateral ventricle of the brain, were used for the determination of the effect, on plasma gh levels, of the intraventricular administration of catecholamines, adrenergic receptor blockers, and serotonin (5- ht). while saline (10 μl/rat) or noradrenaline (1.0 μg/rat) did not induce any significant changes in plasma gh, dopamine (1.0 mg/rat) significantly reduced plasma gh levels. this dopaminergic inhibition is apparently exerted through hypothalamic beta-adrenergic receptors, since it is abolished by the previous administration of propranolol (5o μg/rat), a specific beta-adrenergic blocker. the injections of 5-ht (1.0 μg/rat) were followed by a highly significant rise of plasma gh; this effect was abolished by the previous administration of phenoxybenzamine (50 μg/rat), an alpha-adrenergic blocker, which is also able to block tryptaminergic receptors. when injected alone, propranolol was inactive, while phenoxybenzamine strikingly reduced plasma gh levels. these data suggest that rat gh is under the antagonistic control of a central beta-dopaminergic inhibiting, and a central tryptaminergic stimulating mechanism. central alpha-adrenergic receptors seem on the contrary to be inactive. it is concluded that adult male rats anesthetized with urethane represent a very useful preparation for the study of rat gh secretion and it is suggested that discrepancies observed between experimental results obtained in various laboratories might be due to differences in the way animals are prepared before blood collection.

true,rapid regulation of depression-associated genes in a new mouse model mimicking interferon-α-related depression in hepatitis c virus infection,"major depression is a serious side effect of interferon-α (ifn-α), which is used in the therapy of hepatitis c virus (hcv) infection. due to the lack of reproducible animal models, the mechanisms underlying ifn-α-related depression are largely unknown. we herein established a mouse model, in which murine ifn-α (250 iu/day) and polyinosinic/polycytidylic acid (poly(i:c); 1 μg/day), a toll-like receptor-3 (tlr3) agonist that mimics the effect of hcv double-strand rna, were continuously infused into the lateral ventricle via miniosmotic pumps over up to 14 days. the delivery of ifn-α and poly(i:c), but not of ifn-α or poly(i:c) alone, resulted in a reproducible depression-like state that was characterized by reduced exploration behavior in open-field tests, increased immobility in tail suspension and forced swimming tests, and a moderate loss of body weight. in the hippocampus and prefrontal cortex, the pro-inflammatory genes tnf-α, il-6, tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinases-1 (timp-1), cxc motif ligand-1 (cxcl1), cxcl10, and cc motif ligand-5 (ccl5) were synergistically induced by ifn-α and poly(i:c), most pronounced after 14-day exposure. in comparison, the interferon-inducible genes of signal transducer and activator of transcription-1 (stat1), guanylate binding protein-1 (gbp1), proteasome subunit-β type-9 (psmb9), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme e2l-6 (ube2l6), receptor transporter protein-4 (rtp4), and gtp cyclohydrolase-1 (gch1), which had previously been elevated in the blood of ifn-α-treated patients developing depression, in the brains of suicidal individuals, and in primary neurons exposed to ifn-α and poly(i:c), were induced even earlier, reaching maximum levels mostly after 24 hours. we propose that interferon-inducible genes might be useful markers of imminent depression.",Hoyo-Becerra C,2015,Mol Neurobiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s12035-014-8861-z,25159480,Hoyo-Becerra C; Liu Z; Yao J; Kaltwasser B; Gerken G; Hermann DM; Schlaak JF,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001253: Astrocytes; D001921: Brain; D018925: Chemokines; D003863: Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D005786: Gene Expression Regulation; D016174: Hepacivirus; D006526: Hepatitis C; D016898: Interferon-alpha; D007962: Leukocytes; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D017628: Microglia; D010447: Peptide Hydrolases; D010641: Phenotype; D010766: Phosphorylation; D011070: Poly I-C; D050794: STAT1 Transcription Factor; D050796: STAT3 Transcription Factor; D015398: Signal Transduction",,,https://openalex.org/W2012182735,141,18,1,1812,339,7

false,epidermal growth factor (egf) inhibits the secretomotor response of the thyroid: effects of egf on radioiodine turnover and fluid transport in cultured porcine thyroid cells,"abstract thyrotrophin (4-256 μu/ml) promoted an increase in the rate of release of radioiodine from the organic iodine pool of cultured porcine thyroid cells in follicular formations. this action of tsh was antagonized by low concentrations of epidermal growth factor (egf; 0·1–5 nmol/l). the maximal effect of egf was reached by 0·5 nmol/l. egf (0·5–5 nmol/l) also inhibited the stimulatory effect of 8-chloro cyclic amp (0·06–1·0 nmol/l) on radioiodine turnover. exposure of thyroid cultures to media with a calcium concentration of 17·7 μmol/l (1% of normal) resulted in a very marked increase in the rate of release of radioiodine. the effect of tsh in low-calcium media was to inhibit the increased release of radioiodine, and egf (0·5 nmol/l) antagonized this inhibitory effect of tsh. the calcium ionophore, a23187, stimulated radioiodine release in a dose-dependent fashion, and egf (1·7 nmol/l) inhibited this response. fluid transport in thyroid monolayers was stimulated by prostaglandin e 2 (pge 2 ; 1 μmol/l). egf (5 nmol/l) also stimulated fluid transport, but antagonized the effect of pge 2 added subsequently. it was concluded that egf exerted acute antagonistic effects on thyroid cell responses in vitro to cyclic amp and agents promoting accumulation of cyclic amp in time-frames too short for these inhibitory effects to be attributable to the dedifferentiative effect of the growth factor. journal of endocrinology (1991) 128, 213–218",Bourke JR,1991,J Endocrinol,https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.1280213,2005412,Bourke JR; Murdoch S; Manley SW; Matainaho T; Huxham GJ; Waters MJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D015124: 8-Bromo Cyclic Adenosine Monophosphate; D000818: Animals; D001692: Biological Transport; D000001: Calcimycin; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004815: Epidermal Growth Factor; D007457: Iodine Radioisotopes; D013552: Swine; D013961: Thyroid Gland; D013972: Thyrotropin",,,https://openalex.org/W2040564020,173,28,1,1456,262,11

true,inhibition of glycine transporter-i as a novel mechanism for the treatment of depression,"antidepressants, aiming at monoaminergic neurotransmission, exhibit delayed onset of action, limited efficacy, and poor compliance. glutamatergic neurotransmission is involved in depression. however, it is unclear whether enhancement of the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) subtype glutamate receptor can be a treatment for depression.we studied sarcosine, a glycine transporter-i inhibitor that potentiates nmda function, in animal models and in depressed patients. we investigated its effects in forced swim test, tail suspension test, elevated plus maze test, novelty-suppressed feeding test, and chronic unpredictable stress test in rats and conducted a 6-week randomized, double-blinded, citalopram-controlled trial in 40 patients with major depressive disorder. clinical efficacy and side effects were assessed biweekly, with the main outcomes of hamilton depression rating scale, global assessment of function, and remission rate. the time course of response and dropout rates was also compared.sarcosine decreased immobility in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, reduced the latency to feed in the novelty-suppressed feeding test, and reversed behavioral deficits caused by chronic unpredictable stress test, which are characteristics for an antidepressant. in the clinical study, sarcosine substantially improved scores of hamilton depression rating scale, clinical global impression, and global assessment of function more than citalopram treatment. sarcosine-treated patients were much more likely and quicker to remit and less likely to drop out. sarcosine was well tolerated without significant side effects.our preliminary findings suggest that enhancing nmda function can improve depression-like behaviors in rodent models and in human depression. establishment of glycine transporter-i inhibition as a novel treatment for depression waits for confirmation by further proof-of-principle studies.",Huang CC,2013,Biol Psychiatry,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.biopsych.2013.02.020,23562005,Huang CC; Wei IH; Huang CL; Chen KT; Tsai MH; Tsai P; Tun R; Huang KH; Chang YC; Lane HY; Tsai GE,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D018687: Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; D015283: Citalopram; D003863: Depression; D003865: Depressive Disorder, Major; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D005260: Female; D050487: Glycine Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D012521: Sarcosine",,,https://openalex.org/W2072990488,88,13,1,1917,288,10

false,the effect of chronic undernourishment on the synaptic depression of cutaneous pathways in the rat spinal cord,"the aim of this study was to determine the effect of chronic undernourishment on the amplitude depression of the first negative component in the cord dorsum potentials (n1-cdps) caused by the conditioning stimulation of sensory cutaneous nerves in the rat spinal cord. single electrical pulses (1 hz; 2 times threshold) applied to the sural (su) nerve of control rats (n = 14) produced cdps with a first negative component (n1-cdps) larger in amplitude (14.2 ± 1.3%, p < 0.01) than those recorded in chronically undernourished rats (n = 14; 3 times threshold). the conditioning stimulation of the sp nerve (4 shocks at 300 hz, 3 × t) in the control rats (n = 5) evoked a long-lasting (∼200 ms) depression of the n1-cdp (60.2 ± 7.2%). in contrast such depression was smaller in magnitude (42.5 ± 5.7%, p < 0.01) and time course (100–120 ms) in undernourished rats (n = 7). the systemic application of picrotoxin (ptx) reduced, but did not abolish the conditioned depression of the n1-cdps and drps in both the control and undernourished rats. by assuming that the depression of the n1-cdps is representative of presynaptic mechanisms, it is proposed that chronic undernourishment influence the activation of presynaptic neuronal pathways that regulate the transmitter release of cutaneous afferent fibers in the spinal cord and such effect could act as a compensatory mechanism that counterbalances the decreased activation of spinal neurons by the reduced afferent input in the rat.",Quiroz-González S,2012,Brain Res Bull,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainresbull.2012.07.008,22828571,Quiroz-González S; Segura-Alegría B; Olmos JC; Jiménez-Estrada I,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000200: Action Potentials; D000344: Afferent Pathways; D000818: Animals; D001835: Body Weight; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005260: Female; D018756: GABA Antagonists; D044342: Malnutrition; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D010852: Picrotoxin; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D012867: Skin; D013116: Spinal Cord; D013497: Sural Nerve; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2138745981,110,17,1,1482,287,6
false,energetics of the negative and positive inotropism of pentobarbitone sodium in the canine left ventricle,"pentobarbitone (sodium) is an anaesthetic widely used in animal experiments. it is known to be a cardiovascular depressant and a coronary dilator, but its effects on myocardial energetics in relation to its negative and positive (due to gregg's phenomenon) inotropism have not been studied. the aim of this study was therefore to determine whether and how pentobarbitone affects cardiac mechanoenergetics compared with other negative inotropic agents for which data are already available.the effects of graded doses of intracoronary pentobarbitone on mechanoenergetics were studied in the excised cross circulated left ventricles of 12 dogs. the framework of the emax (a contractility index)--vo2 (myocardial oxygen consumption)--pva (systolic pressure-volume area, a measure of total mechanical energy) relationships was fully utilised.pentobarbitone increased emax at low doses in five of the 12 hearts. in two of these five hearts, a marked coronary dilatation was found. pentobarbitone decreased emax dose dependently at high doses in all the hearts and lowered the vo2 intercept but not the slope (oxygen cost of pva) of the vo2-pva relation. there was no difference in oxygen cost of emax between pentobarbitone and cacl2, although they have opposite inotropism. these findings suggest that pentobarbitone depresses myocardial mechanoenergetics via suppression of total calcium handling in the excitation-contraction-relaxation coupling.pentobarbitone at low doses partly acts as a positive inotropic agent, but at high doses it acts as a negative inotropic agent like beta blockers and calcium antagonists on cardiac mechanoenergetics in canine blood perfused hearts.",Namba T,1994,Cardiovasc Res,https://doi.org/10.1093/cvr/28.4.557,8181046,Namba T; Takaki M; Araki J; Ishioka K; Suga H,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D002122: Calcium Chloride; D003326: Coronary Circulation; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004285: Dogs; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D009206: Myocardium; D010101: Oxygen Consumption; D010424: Pentobarbital; D010477: Perfusion; D013268: Stimulation, Chemical; D013318: Stroke Volume; D014655: Vascular Resistance",,,https://openalex.org/W2160976289,104,15,1,1674,270,8
false,regulation of phosphodiesterase-4 (pde4) expression in mouse brain by repeated antidepressant treatment: comparison with rolipram,"cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase-4 (pde4) is a component of signaling pathways involved in the mediation of antidepressant activity. of the four pde4 subtypes, pde4d appears to be of particular importance, given the finding that pde4d-deficient mice exhibit an antidepressant-like behavioral phenotype. in mouse hippocampus and cerebral cortex, the effects of repeated treatment with the antidepressants desipramine and fluoxetine or the pde4 inhibitor rolipram on the expression of pde4d was compared to that of pde4a and pde4b, the other two subtypes expressed in the brain. expression of pde4d was increased by all drugs tested, with the exception of desipramine in hippocampus. by contrast, these treatments affected pde4a and pde4b expression differentially. in hippocampus, antidepressants increased pde4a and decreased pde4b, whereas rol decreased pde4a and did not change pde4b. in cerebral cortex, antidepressants increased pde4a and did not change pde4b, whereas rol did not change pde4a and increased pde4b. 3h-rolipram binding was increased in cytosolic, but not in membrane, fractions of cerebral cortex by all drugs tested; there were no changes observed in hippocampus. overall, the present results suggest some species-dependence of the regulation of pde4 subtypes, based on data obtained previously using rats. they also suggest that the pde4d subtype may be of particular importance as an antidepressant target in that it is regulated by repeated treatment with both norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake inhibitors as well as by the pde4 inhibitor rolipram, drugs that produce antidepressant effects via different neuropharmacological mechanisms.",Dlaboga D,2006,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2006.04.032,16730340,Dlaboga D; Hajjhussein H; O'Donnell JM,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D015105: 3',5'-Cyclic-AMP Phosphodiesterases; D018759: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001921: Brain; D019556: COS Cells; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D002522: Chlorocebus aethiops; D054703: Cyclic Nucleotide Phosphodiesterases, Type 4; D003600: Cytosol; D004591: Electrophoresis, Polyacrylamide Gel; D006624: Hippocampus; D007150: Immunohistochemistry; D007527: Isoenzymes; D008297: Male; D008566: Membranes; D051379: Mice; D008813: Mice, Inbred ICR; D020889: Rolipram; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",,,https://openalex.org/W2083368251,129,18,1,1668,267,10

false,repetitive hypoxia rapidly depresses arousal from active sleep in newborn lambs,"arousal from sleep is an important protective mechanism that is depressed by repeated episodes of hypoxia. we aimed to determine how rapidly arousal depression occurs during repeated hypoxia and to determine if the depression is sleep state specific. three successive 12 h overnight sleep recordings were performed in six newborn lambs instrumented to record sleep state, blood pressure, heart rate and blood gases. the first (control) and third (recovery) nights were baseline studies (inspired oxygen fraction, f i,o2 = 0.21 ) to determine the spontaneous arousal probability. during the second (test) study night, lambs were exposed to a 60 s episode of isocapnic hypoxia ( f i,o2 = 0.10 ; inspired carbon dioxide fraction, f i,co2 = 0.03 ) during every epoch of sleep. during quiet sleep (qs), the probability of arousing to hypoxia (56 %) remained significantly higher than the probability of arousing spontaneously (18 %) throughout the repeated hypoxic exposures ( χ 2 = 81.5, p < 0.001 ). by contrast, during active sleep (as) arousal rapidly became depressed with repetition of the hypoxic stimulus; the probability of arousal in hypoxia (52 %) was significantly higher than the probability of spontaneous arousal (12 %) during the first ten hypoxic exposures ( χ 2 = 18.2, p < 0.001 ), but there was no difference thereafter. we conclude that, when repeated, moderate hypoxia very rapidly becomes ineffective as an arousing stimulus in as, but not in qs. these results suggest that the arousal mechanism is particularly vulnerable to failure during as.",Johnston RV,1998,J Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-7793.1998.651bk.x,9706012,Johnston RV; Grant DA; Wilkinson MH; Walker AM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D001143: Arousal; D001784: Blood Gas Analysis; D006439: Hemodynamics; D000860: Hypoxia; D012756: Sheep; D012890: Sleep; D012895: Sleep, REM",,,https://openalex.org/W2164250057,79,11,1,1568,304,9
false,aortic baroreceptor characteristics in dogs with chronic high output failure,"it has been shown that the arterial baroreflex is depressed in heart failure. the role of alterations in afferent discharge as a possible mechanism for this depression has not been investigated previously. single unit aortic baroreceptor activity was recorded from six normal dogs and from nine dogs, each with a chronic aorto-caval fistula (avf). at the time of the acute experiment, mean arterial blood pressure (mabp) was not significantly different in the two groups of dogs; however, pulse pressure was significantly higher in the avf dogs (45.7 +/- 2.4 mm hg vs, 24.4 +/- 2.0 mm hg; p less than 0.001). left ventricular end-diastolic pressure (lvedp) was higher in the avf dogs (31.3 +/- 2.0 vs 5.6 +/- 1.8 mm hg; p less than 0.001). avf dogs had elevated heart weight/body weight ratios. the relationship of systolic aortic pressure to systolic discharge was examined by changing aortic pressure with aortic and vena caval occluders. the peak gain (normalized to maximum discharge) averaged 2.19 +/- 0.27 in the normal dogs compared to 1.15 +/- 0.09 in the avf group (p less than 0.01). saturation pressures and maximum discharge rates were greater in the avf dogs although the threshold pressures were not different in the two groups. this data suggests that there is an attenuated response of aortic baroreceptor discharge in dogs with chronic volume overload and this abnormality may partially be responsible for the abnormal baroreflex in heart failure.",Niebauer MJ,1986,Basic Res Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf01907376,3741352,Niebauer MJ; Holmberg MJ; Zucker IH,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001013: Aorta, Thoracic; D001166: Arteriovenous Shunt, Surgical; D001794: Blood Pressure; D003187: Compliance; D003250: Constriction; D004285: Dogs; D005260: Female; D006333: Heart Failure; D006439: Hemodynamics; D008297: Male; D011311: Pressoreceptors; D014682: Vena Cava, Inferior",,,https://openalex.org/W2021655220,76,10,1,1464,269,10

false,natriuresis induced by alpha and beta melanocyte stimulating hormone (msh) in rats,"α- and β-msh produced a marked natriuretic effect when injected ip in trained, fasted water-loaded rats. doses of 50 and 90 μg of β-msh produced a significant natriuresis, kaliuresis, and no change in urine output. doses of 5, 10, and 50 μg of α-msh produced a doserelated natriuresis, kaliuresis, and antidiuresis. the low doses of 1 and 2 μg of α-msh also produced a significant increase in na+ excretion without affecting k+ excretion or urine output. since the natriuresis outpaced the kaliuresis, the na+/k+ ratio increased. a 100 mu dose of oxytocin induced natriuresis, kaliuresis and a slight antidiuresis. the dose of 0.5 mu of lysinevasopressin produced a significant natriuresis and kaliuresis in the 20-40 min sample after injection, but the 1 mu dose was natriuretic and kaliuretic only in the 40-60 min sample. both doses produced a significant antidiuresis. treatment with thioglycollate to inactivate any vasopressin or oxytocin contaminating the α-msh did not alter the natriuretic effect but eliminated the antidiuresis. since thioglycollate eliminated the natriuretic effect of oxytocin, it is concluded that α- and β- msh possess natriuretic activity in the rat.

false,role of endocannabinoids and cannabinoid-1 receptors in cerebrocortical blood flow regulation,"endocannabinoids are among the most intensively studied lipid mediators of cardiovascular functions. in the present study the effects of decreased and increased activity of the endocannabinoid system (achieved by cannabinoid-1 (cb1) receptor blockade and inhibition of cannabinoid reuptake, respectively) on the systemic and cerebral circulation were analyzed under steady-state physiological conditions and during hypoxia and hypercapnia (h/h).in anesthetized spontaneously ventilating rats the cb1-receptor antagonist/inverse agonist am-251 (10 mg/kg, i.v.) failed to influence blood pressure (bp), cerebrocortical blood flow (cobf, measured by laser-doppler flowmetry) or arterial blood gas levels. in contrast, the putative cannabinoid reuptake inhibitor am-404 (10 mg/kg, i.v.) induced triphasic responses, some of which could be blocked by am-251. hypertension during phase i was resistant to am-251, whereas the concomitant cobf-increase was attenuated. in contrast, hypotension during phase iii was sensitive to am-251, whereas the concomitant cobf-decrease was not. therefore, cobf autoregulation appeared to shift towards higher bp levels after cb1-blockade. during phase ii h/h developed due to respiratory depression, which could be inhibited by am-251. interestingly, however, the concomitant rise in cobf remained unchanged after am-251, indicating that cb1-blockade potentially enhanced the reactivity of the cobf to h/h. in accordance with this hypothesis, am-251 induced a significant enhancement of the cobf responses during controlled stepwise h/h.under resting physiological conditions cb1-receptor mediated mechanisms appear to have limited influence on systemic or cerebral circulation. enhancement of endocannabinoid levels, however, induces transient cb1-independent hypertension and sustained cb1-mediated hypotension. furthermore, enhanced endocannabinoid activity results in respiratory depression in a cb1-dependent manner. finally, our data indicate for the first time the involvement of the endocannabinoid system and cb1-receptors in the regulation of the cerebral circulation during h/h and also raise the possibility of their contribution to the autoregulation of cobf.",Iring A,2013,PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0053390,23308211,Iring A; Ruisanchez É; Leszl-Ishiguro M; Horváth B; Benkő R; Lacza Z; Járai Z; Sándor P; Di Marzo V; Pacher P; Benyó Z,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052060: Research Support, N.I.H., Intramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001095: Arachidonic Acids; D062186: Arterial Pressure; D002560: Cerebrovascular Circulation; D063388: Endocannabinoids; D006339: Heart Rate; D006439: Hemodynamics; D006935: Hypercapnia; D006973: Hypertension; D000860: Hypoxia; D017078: Laser-Doppler Flowmetry; D008297: Male; D010880: Piperidines; D011720: Pyrazoles; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D043884: Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1",,,https://openalex.org/W2060237574,93,11,1,2202,336,14

(2) the output flows of the atpase and of the site i redox h(+)-pumps exhibit a steep dependence on delta mu h+. the flow-force relationships differ depending on whether the depression of delta mu h+ is induced by inhibitors of the h(+)-generating pump, by uncouplers or by lipophilic anions. (3) with the atpase as h(+)-consuming pump, at equivalent delta mu h+ values, the output flow is more markedly inhibited by malonate than by uncouplers; the latter, however, are more inhibitory than lipophilic anions such as clo4-. with redox site i as proton-consuming pump, at equivalent delta mu h+ values, the output flow is more markedly inhibited by oligomycin than by uncouplers; again, uncouplers are more inhibitory than clo4-.

false,inbreeding depression in insular and central populations of peromyscus mice,"we tested the hypothesis that small, isolated populations would show less depression in fitness when inbred than would large, central populations. laboratory stocks of peromyscus leucopus and p. polionotus were established from insular, peninsular, and central populations. the isolated populations had one-third to one-half the genic diversity of central populations. responses to inbreeding were highly varied: some populations had smaller litters, others experienced higher mortality, some showed slower growth rates, and one displayed no measurable effects when inbred. these results suggest that inbreeding depression is controlled by a small number of genes and that the size of the genetic load depends on which alleles are present in the founders of a population. the severity of fitness depression in inbred litters did not correlate with initial genic diversity of the stocks nor, therefore, with the size of the wild populations. fitness measures appeared linearly related to the inbreeding coefficient of the liters, with no diminution of deleterious effects through subsequent generations of inbreeding. thus overdominance of fitness traits probably contributed as much to the genetic load as did deleterious recessive alleles. the inbreeding level of the dam negatively affected the size, growth, and survival of litters only in genetically diverse populations, indicating that the load of recessive alleles negatively impacting maternal care may have been reduced by selection in the more peripheral populations during past bottlenecks.",Brewer BA,1990,J Hered,https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordjournals.jhered.a110988,2273239,Brewer BA; Lacy RC; Foster ML; Alaks G,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D003411: Arvicolinae; D003433: Crosses, Genetic; D004586: Electrophoresis; D005260: Female; D005787: Gene Frequency; D014644: Genetic Variation; D005828: Genetics, Population; D007178: Inbreeding; D007527: Isoenzymes; D008297: Male; D011897: Random Allocation; D012044: Regression Analysis; D012098: Reproduction; D012641: Selection, Genetic",,,https://openalex.org/W1829513867,75,10,1,1551,248,9

false,effect of amiloride on sodium and water reabsorption in the rabbit gall‐bladder.,"the effects of the na+-channel-blocking diuretic agent amiloride were assessed in the rabbit gall-bladder epithelium, a low-resistance epithelium with an isosmotic, coupled nacl transport mechanism. amiloride caused a rapid, reversible, and dose-dependent decrease in fluid absorption when applied from the mucosal side in concentrations between 8.8 x 10(-5) and 1.76 x 10(-3) m. these concentrations were without effect from the serosal side, suggesting an action of amiloride in the luminal cell membrane as in high-resistance epithelia. amiloride did not affect the epithelial resistance or the passive serosa-to-mucosa na+ flux, while net na+ and water reabsorption were inhibited in parallel. thus, amiloride did not affect the paracellular tight junction pathway, but inhibited a transcellular, coupled salt and water transport mechanism. the kinetics of the amiloride effect were of a michaelis-menten type. the dose of amiloride giving 50% inhibition of fluid absorption (id50) was 4 x 10(-4) m, a value about three orders of magnitude higher than in high-resistance, na+-retaining epithelia. the percentage inhibitory effect at each concentration of amiloride increased with increasing rate of spontaneous (control) fluid transport, reaching maximal responses fitting a michaelis-menten kinetic with an id50 of 1.5 x 10(-4) m. no effects of changing the extracellular na+ concentration between 51 and 145 mequiv/l on the maximal inhibitory effect of amiloride on na+ and water reabsorption were observed. this suggests a non-competitive type of action of amiloride on a na+-dependent isosmotic fluid transport mechanism. removal of mucosal ca2+ did not alter the effect of amiloride. the implications of these findings are discussed in relation to concepts concerning the mechanism of isosmotic salt and water transport. the data are compatible with the concept that amiloride interferes with a na+-dependent formation and transcellular transport of isosmotic fluid volumes in a sequestered compartment in the epithelial cells.",Frederiksen O,1983,J Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1113/jphysiol.1983.sp014520,6875899,Frederiksen O,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000042: Absorption; D000584: Amiloride; D000818: Animals; D001692: Biological Transport; D002118: Calcium; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005260: Female; D005704: Gallbladder; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D011719: Pyrazines; D011817: Rabbits; D012964: Sodium; D013997: Time Factors; D014867: Water",,,https://openalex.org/W2119403067,80,13,1,2036,335,11
false,inhibition of na+/h+ exchanger type 3 reduces duration of apnea induced by laryngeal stimulation in piglets,"reflexes from the larynx induce cessation of breathing in newborn animals. the magnitude of respiratory inhibition is inversely related to the level of central chemical input. recent studies indicate that selective inhibition of na(+)/h(+) exchanger type 3 (nhe3) activates co(2)/h(+)-sensitive neurons, resembling the responses evoked by hypercapnic stimuli. hence, the use of nhe3 inhibitors may reduce reflexly mediated respiratory depression and duration of apnea in the neonatal period. this possibility was examined in decerebrate, vagotomized, ventilated, and paralyzed piglets by testing the effects of i.v. administration of nhe3 blocker s8218 on the response of phrenic nerve amplitude, frequency, and duration of apnea induced by graded electrical stimulation of the superior laryngeal nerve. superior laryngeal nerve stimulation caused a significant decrease in phrenic nerve amplitude, frequency, minute phrenic activity, and inspiratory time (all p < 0.01) that was proportional to the level of electrical stimulation. increased levels of stimulation were more likely to induce apnea both during and after cessation of stimulation. nhe3 blocker s8218 reduced the superior laryngeal nerve stimulation-induced decrease in phrenic nerve amplitude, minute phrenic activity, and phrenic nerve frequency (all p < 0.05) and reduced superior laryngeal nerve stimulation-induced apnea and duration of poststimulation apnea (p < 0.05). in six other pigs the brain concentrations of s8218 were measured at different intervals after i.v. administration of the drug and were found to be higher in the brain tissue than plasma at all intervals. these findings suggest that the use of nhe3 blockers may decrease the duration of apnea and possibly reduce the pathophysiologic consequences of potentially life-threatening apnea in infants.",Abu-Shaweesh JM,2002,Pediatr Res,https://doi.org/10.1203/00006450-200209000-00026,12193685,Abu-Shaweesh JM; Dreshaj IA; Martin RJ; Wirth KJ; Heinelt U; Haxhiu MA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D001049: Apnea; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D007823: Laryngeal Nerves; D007830: Larynx; D010791: Phrenic Nerve; D012119: Respiration; D000074083: Sodium-Hydrogen Exchanger 3; D017923: Sodium-Hydrogen Exchangers; D013552: Swine",,,https://openalex.org/W2082571570,107,16,1,1836,310,12
false,modulation of epileptiform activity by glutamine and system a transport in a model of post-traumatic epilepsy,"epileptic activity arises from an imbalance in excitatory and inhibitory synaptic transmission. to determine if alterations in the metabolism of glutamate, the primary excitatory neurotransmitter, might contribute to epilepsy we directly and indirectly modified levels of glutamine, an immediate precursor of synaptically released glutamate, in the rat neocortical undercut model of hyperexcitability and epilepsy. we show that slices from injured cortex take up glutamine more readily than control slices, and an increased expression of the system a transporters snat1 and snat2 likely underlies this difference. we also examined the effect of exogenous glutamine on evoked and spontaneous activity and found that addition of physiological concentrations of glutamine to perfusate of slices isolated from injured cortex increased the incidence and decreased the refractory period of epileptiform potentials. by contrast, exogenous glutamine increased the amplitude of evoked potentials in normal cortex, but did not induce epileptiform potentials. addition of physiological concentrations of glutamine to perfusate of slices isolated from injured cortex greatly increased abnormal spontaneous activity in the form of events resembling spreading depression, again while having no effect on slices from normal cortex. interestingly, similar spreading depression like events were noted in control slices at supraphysiological levels of glutamine. in the undercut cortex addition of methylaminoisobutyric acid (meaib), an inhibitor of the system a glutamine transporters attenuated all physiological effects of added glutamine suggesting that uptake through these transporters is required for the effect of glutamine. our findings support a role for glutamine transport through snat1 and/or snat2 in the maintenance of abnormal activity in this in vitro model of epileptogenesis and suggest that system a transport and glutamine metabolism are potential targets for pharmacological intervention in seizures and epilepsy.",Tani H,2007,Neurobiol Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2006.08.025,17070687,Tani H; Bandrowski AE; Parada I; Wynn M; Huguenard JR; Prince DA; Reimer RJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000200: Action Potentials; D026924: Amino Acid Transport System A; D026905: Amino Acid Transport Systems; D000818: Animals; D001930: Brain Injuries; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D013181: Cortical Spreading Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D004834: Epilepsy, Post-Traumatic; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D005973: Glutamine; D009924: Organ Culture Techniques; D051381: Rats; D015091: beta-Alanine",,,https://openalex.org/W2058701143,109,16,1,2017,300,9
false,prepro-thyrotropin releasing hormone 178-199 immunoreactivity is altered in the hypothalamus of the wistar–kyoto strain of rat,"the rat prepro-thyrotropin releasing hormone (trh) 178-199 is derived from prepro-trh by the actions of the endopeptidases, prohormone convertase 1 (pc1) and pc2. pptrh 178-199 attenuates the synthesis and secretion of adrenocorticotropic hormone (acth) from the anterior pituitary both in vitro and in vivo, suggesting an inhibitory action on hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis function. this peptide also acts centrally to increase activity and decrease anxiety related behaviors. to elucidate the involvement of this peptide in these functions, we have compared the expression of pptrh 178-199, pptrh mrna, and pc1 and pc2 mrnas in the wistar-kyoto (wky) and wistar strains of rat. wky rats have been shown to possess neuroendocrine abnormalities (hpa hyper-activity) and hyper-emotional behavioral characteristics. immunohistochemical analysis of pptrh 178-199 demonstrated significant strain differences in the paraventricular nucleus (pvn) of the hypothalamus and the parastrial nucleus (psn). wky rats had significantly greater numbers of immunoreactive (ir) cell body profiles (p<0.0005) than wistar rats in the pvn and a significantly lower fiber density (p<0.002) in the psn. levels of pptrh, pc1, and pc2 mrna were not different between strains in any brain region examined. these data suggest that altered levels of pptrh 178-199 in wky rats could cause, at least in part, the hyper-activity of the hpa axis and the hyper-emotional behavioral characteristics seen in this rat strain. such data fit with the hypothesis that pptrh 178-199 is involved in the regulation of the hpa axis and behavior.",Suzuki S,2001,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-8993(01)02853-0,11549391,Suzuki S; Solberg LC; Redei EE; Handa RJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000324: Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; D000818: Animals; D016282: Aspartic Acid Endopeptidases; D001369: Axons; D003863: Depression; D007030: Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; D007150: Immunohistochemistry; D008297: Male; D010286: Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus; D010446: Peptide Fragments; D045706: Proprotein Convertase 2; D043484: Proprotein Convertases; D011498: Protein Precursors; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D051381: Rats; D011921: Rats, Inbred WKY; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013312: Stress, Physiological; D013381: Subtilisins; D013973: Thyrotropin-Releasing Hormone",,,https://openalex.org/W2019065360,126,16,1,1615,282,10
false,chronic administration of imipramine and lithium changes the phase-angle relationship between the activity and core body temperature circadian rhythms in rats,"evidence suggests that there is an association between the pathophysiology of depression and a disturbance of circadian rhythms. accordingly, attention has focused on the possible effects of antidepressants on circadian rhythms. in the present study, we examined the effects of chronic administration of two clinically effective antidepressant agents, imipramine and lithium, on several circadian rhythms in the rat. activity, core body temperature, and drinking rhythms were assessed in constant darkness (dd) and light-dark (ld) conditions. in dd, lithium significantly lengthened the circadian period of the activity, temperature, and drinking rhythms, while imipramine had no effect. in ld, both drugs significantly delayed the phase of the activity rhythm, but did not change that of the other two rhythms. as a result, the phase-angle differences between the activity and temperature rhythms significantly increased. neither lithium nor imipramine produced any effect on the resynchronization of these rhythms after an 8-h delay in the ld cycle. these results indicate that although both drugs produced different effects on the circadian period of individual rhythms, both caused a relative phase advance of the temperature rhythm as compared to the activity rhythm, and this effect may be related to the similarity in their antidepressant effects.

true,benzodiazepine withdrawal facilitates the subsequent onset of escape failures and anhedonia: influence of different antidepressant drugs,"the effect of benzodiazepine (bdz) withdrawal on escape acquisition and on the behavioral response to two different reinforcing stimuli was investigated. in addition, the influence of antidepressant drugs (ad) differing in their mechanism of action on these behavioral outputs was also evaluated. rats subjected to withdrawal from a chronic treatment with diazepam (dzm; 2 mg/kg per day, i.p.) during 21 days were subsequently exposed to a brief inescapable shock session (is) and 48 h later to an active avoidance test. only withdrawn animals exposed to the is exhibited enhanced escape failures. in an additional experiment, withdrawn rats were repeatedly administered with vehicle (veh), desipramine (dmi; 5 mg/kg, i.p.), fluoxetine (flu; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) or phenelzine (phen; 5 mg/kg, i.p.) and subsequently exposed to is and to active avoidance task. a significant reversal of escape deficit was only observed following dmi and phen but not after flu. furthermore, withdrawn rats showed a reduced preference for a sexually relevant olfactory cue, this reduced sensitivity was only normalized following dmi but not after the administration of flu or phen. finally, rats exposed to abrupt cessation of chronic bdz administration did not exhibit preference for a context previously associated with amphetamine (amp) under the conditioned place preference (cpp) procedure. all these findings are indicative that bdz withdrawal facilitates the subsequent occurrence of behavioral changes—escape failures and reduced behavioral response to rewarding stimuli—suggested to parallel important symptoms of human depression. in addition, dmi seems to be much more effective in restoring such behavioral abnormalities as compared to a mao inhibitor and to a inhibitor of 5-ht uptake.",Lacerra C,1999,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0006-8993(98)01341-9,10082859,Lacerra C; Martijena ID; Bustos SG; Molina VA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000661: Amphetamine; D000818: Animals; D014151: Anti-Anxiety Agents; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001362: Avoidance Learning; D003214: Conditioning, Classical; D003463: Cues; D003891: Desipramine; D003975: Diazepam; D004597: Electroshock; D004924: Escape Reaction; D005473: Fluoxetine; D008297: Male; D009812: Odorants; D010624: Phenelzine; D051381: Rats; D012726: Sexual Behavior, Animal; D013375: Substance Withdrawal Syndrome; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2006501790,136,17,1,1774,312,14
false,combined atorvastatin and coenzyme q10 improve the left ventricular function in isoproterenol-induced heart failure in rat,"the effect of atorvastatin on cardiac remodeling, function, and homodynamic parameters in isoproterenol-induced heart failure was evaluated in the present study. a subcutaneous injection of isoproterenol (5mg/kg/day) for 10 days was used for the induction of heart failure. isoproterenol administration produced intensive myocardial necrosis and fibrosis with a significant decrease in the arterial pressure indices, heart rate, contractility (lvdp/dt(max)) and relaxation (lvdp/dt(min)), but an increase in the left ventricular end-diastolic pressure. rats were randomly assigned to control, treatment with only atorvastatin, and treatment with atorvastatin plus coenzyme q10. histopathological analysis showed a marked attenuation of myocyte necrosis and interstitial fibrosis in all atorvastatin treated groups (p<0.001). a low dose of atorvastatin (5mg/kg/day) significantly improved the left ventricular systolic pressure, contractility and relaxation (p<0.01). on the contrary, a high dose of atorvastatin (20mg/kg/day) worsened the isoproterenol-induced left ventricular dysfunction by a further reduction of lvdp/dt(max) from +2780 ± 94 to +1588 ± 248 (mmhg/s; p<0.01) and lvdp/dt(min) from -2007 ± 190 to -2939 ± 291 (mmhg/s; p<0.05). co-administration of coenzyme q10 with atorvastatin reversed the hemodynamic depression and the left ventricular dysfunction to a high level (p<0.001). there was a lower level of lvedps in the atorvastatin+coenzyme q10 treated groups (3 ± 1 and 4 ± 1.4 versus 8 ± 3.5 and 14 ± 3.6 mmhg, respectively), thereby suggesting improvement in the myocardial stiffness by the combined coenzyme q10 and atorvastatin treatment. the atorvastatin therapy attenuated myocardial necrosis and fibrosis in isoproterenol-induced heart failure. however, a high dose of the drug considerably worsened the left ventricular dysfunction and hemodynamic depression, which was reversed by coenzyme q10 co-administration.",Garjani A,2011,Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2011.04.061,21570962,Garjani A; Andalib S; Biabani S; Soraya H; Doustar Y; Garjani A; Maleki-Dizaji N,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000069059: Atorvastatin; D001835: Body Weight; D004347: Drug Interactions; D006333: Heart Failure; D006439: Hemodynamics; D006538: Heptanoic Acids; D019161: Hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA Reductase Inhibitors; D007545: Isoproterenol; D008297: Male; D009206: Myocardium; D009929: Organ Size; D011758: Pyrroles; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D014451: Ubiquinone; D018487: Ventricular Dysfunction, Left",,,https://openalex.org/W2067747873,122,16,1,1940,336,11

false,heterosynaptic plasticity prevents runaway synaptic dynamics,"spike timing-dependent plasticity (stdp) and other conventional hebbian-type plasticity rules are prone to produce runaway dynamics of synaptic weights. once potentiated, a synapse would have higher probability to lead to spikes and thus to be further potentiated, but once depressed, a synapse would tend to be further depressed. the runaway synaptic dynamics can be prevented by precisely balancing stdp rules for potentiation and depression; however, experimental evidence shows a great variety of potentiation and depression windows and magnitudes. here we show that modifications of synapses to layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons from rat visual and auditory cortices in slices can be induced by intracellular tetanization: bursts of postsynaptic spikes without presynaptic stimulation. induction of these heterosynaptic changes depended on the rise of intracellular calcium, and their direction and magnitude correlated with initial state of release mechanisms. we suggest that this type of plasticity serves as a mechanism that stabilizes the distribution of synaptic weights and prevents their runaway dynamics. to test this hypothesis, we develop a cortical neuron model implementing both homosynaptic (stdp) and heterosynaptic plasticity with properties matching the experimental data. we find that heterosynaptic plasticity effectively prevented runaway dynamics for the tested range of stdp and input parameters. synaptic weights, although shifted from the original, remained normally distributed and nonsaturated. our study presents a biophysically constrained model of how the interaction of different forms of plasticity--hebbian and heterosynaptic--may prevent runaway synaptic dynamics and keep synaptic weights unsaturated and thus capable of further plastic changes and formation of new memories.",Chen JY,2013,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.5088-12.2013,24089497,Chen JY; Lonjers P; Lee C; Chistiakova M; Volgushev M; Bazhenov M,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D001303: Auditory Cortex; D003198: Computer Simulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D008959: Models, Neurological; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009474: Neurons; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D014793: Visual Cortex",,,https://openalex.org/W1963929105,60,6,1,1808,278,10
true,dysregulation of neuregulin-1/erbb signaling in the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus of rats exposed to chronic unpredictable mild stress,"exposure to chronic stress increases the likelihood of developing depression, but the underlying mechanisms remain equivocal. while recent evidence has indicated that neuregulin-1 (nrg1) and its erbb receptors play an essential role in neural development and function, and nrg1 has emerged as a novel modulator involved in the response of brain to stress, there is limited evidence concerning the effects of chronic stress exposure on nrg1/erbb signaling. to fill this critical gap, we examined the protein expression of nrg1 and erbb receptors in the brain of rats following chronic unpredictable mild stress (cums) exposure. after 6weeks of cums procedures, the rats were induced to a depression-like state. the stressed rats displayed elevated expression of nrg1 and phosphorylated erbb4 (perbb4) in the prefrontal cortex, whereas erbb2 and perbb2 were inhibited. in the hippocampus, cums also attenuated activation of the both erbb receptors and suppressed the downstream akt and erk phosphorylation. meanwhile, administration of sertraline enhanced nrg1/erbb signaling and partly normalized the stress-induced behavioral changes and the disturbances of nrg1/erbb system in cums rats. combined, our data firstly showed the aberrant changes of nrg1/erbb system in the brain of the animal model of depression, providing new evidence for the involvement of nrg1/erbb pathway in the development and treatment of depression.",Dang R,2016,Physiol Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.physbeh.2015.11.023,26626816,Dang R; Cai H; Zhang L; Liang D; Lv C; Guo Y; Yang R; Zhu Y; Jiang P,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D003345: Corticosterone; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D005518: Food Preferences; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D020890: Neuregulin-1; D018739: Oncogene Proteins v-erbB; D017397: Prefrontal Cortex; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D020280: Sertraline; D015398: Signal Transduction; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D013550: Swimming",,,https://openalex.org/W2178771849,138,18,1,1423,232,8

false,the effect of lofepramine and other related agents on the motility of tetrahymena pyriformis,"tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) were introduced almost 50 years ago. whilst there is no doubt that tcas are effective in treating depression, they are also more cardiotoxic when taken in overdose than other antidepressant groups. lofepramine is a more recently introduced modified tca, which in animals and man has low toxicity when compared to older tcas. paradoxically, lofepramine is extensively metabolised to desipramine, which has considerable toxicity, both experimentally and in overdose. the toxicity of such compounds is attributed, in part, to a membrane stabilising effect (msa) on cell membranes. this msa causes gross effects to the cell structure and in turn, normal cell activity. the aim of this study was to compare the msa of lofepramine with that of desipramine and amitriptyline in order to see if this might help to explain the low toxicity of lofepramine. the local anaesthetic agent lignocaine was also studied for comparison. each compound was enclosed in a beta-cyclodextrin to increase its solubility in aqueous medium. the extent of msa was determined as a measure of the effect on the swimming speed of the protozoan tetrahymena pyriformis using a video image analysis system. the ic50s for the various drugs were then correlated with their respective octanol-water partition coefficient values (pow). amitriptyline had an ic50 of 1.26+/-0.29 mm, desipramine 75.99+/-14.40 mm, while lofepramine had an ic50 of 357.40+/-25.00 mm. lignocaine had an ic50 of 85.73+/-18.30 mm. there was also a significant correlation between the ic50 values and the pow values.",Darcy P,2002,Toxicol Lett,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0378-4274(01)00542-2,11869831,Darcy P; Kelly JP; Leonard BE; Henry JA,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article,"D000639: Amitriptyline; D000818: Animals; D000929: Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; D002462: Cell Membrane; D003505: Cyclodextrins; D003891: Desipramine; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D007091: Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; D020128: Inhibitory Concentration 50; D008127: Lofepramine; D018709: Statistics, Nonparametric; D013550: Swimming; D013769: Tetrahymena pyriformis; D014741: Video Recording; D047392: beta-Cyclodextrins",,,https://openalex.org/W1980451687,92,14,1,1587,274,14

false,new rules governing synaptic plasticity in core nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons,"the nucleus accumbens is a forebrain region responsible for drug reward and goal-directed behaviors. it has long been believed that drugs of abuse exert their addictive properties on behavior by altering the strength of synaptic communication over long periods of time. to date, attempts at understanding the relationship between drugs of abuse and synaptic plasticity have relied on the high-frequency long-term potentiation model of t.v. bliss & t. lømo [(1973) journal of physiology, 232, 331-356]. we examined synaptic plasticity using spike-timing-dependent plasticity, a stimulation paradigm that reflects more closely the in vivo firing patterns of mouse core nucleus accumbens medium spiny neurons and their afferents. in contrast to other brain regions, the same stimulation paradigm evoked bidirectional long-term plasticity. the magnitude of spike-timing-dependent long-term potentiation (tltp) changed with the delay between action potentials and excitatory post-synaptic potentials, and frequency, whereas that of spike-timing-dependent long-term depression (tltd) remained unchanged. we showed that tltp depended on n-methyl-d-aspartate receptors, whereas tltd relied on action potentials. importantly, the intracellular calcium signaling pathways mobilised during tltp and tltd were different. thus, calcium-induced calcium release underlies tltd but not tltp. finally, we found that the firing pattern of a subset of medium spiny neurons was strongly inhibited by dopamine receptor agonists. surprisingly, these neurons were exclusively associated with tltp but not with tltd. taken together, these data point to the existence of two subgroups of medium spiny neurons with distinct properties, each displaying unique abilities to undergo synaptic plasticity.",Ji X,2012,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1111/ejn.12002,23013293,Ji X; Martin GE,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D020013: Calcium Signaling; D018491: Dopamine Agonists; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009474: Neurons; D009714: Nucleus Accumbens; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",,,https://openalex.org/W2003248744,86,12,1,1774,278,13
true,a mouse model of non-motor symptoms in parkinson's disease: focus on pharmacological interventions targeting affective dysfunctions,"non-motor symptoms, including psychiatric disorders, are increasingly recognized as a major challenge in the treatment of parkinson's disease (pd). these ailments, which often appear in the early stage of the disease, affect a large number of patients and are only partly resolved by conventional antiparkinsonian medications, such as l-dopa. here, we investigated non-motor symptoms of pd in a mouse model based on bilateral injection of the toxin 6-hydroxydopamine (6-ohda) in the dorsal striatum. this model presented only subtle gait modifications, which did not affect horizontal motor activity in the open-field test. bilateral 6-ohda lesion also impaired olfactory discrimination, in line with the anosmia typically observed in early stage parkinsonism. the effect of 6-ohda was then examined for mood-related dysfunctions. lesioned mice showed increased immobility in the forced swim test and tail suspension test, two behavioral paradigms of depression. moreover, the lesion exerted anxiogenic effects, as shown by reduced time spent in the open arms, in the elevated plus maze test, and by increased thigmotaxis in the open-field test. l-dopa did not modify depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors, which were instead counteracted by the dopamine d2/d3 receptor agonist, pramipexole. reboxetine, a noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor, was also able to revert the depressive and anxiogenic effects produced by the lesion with 6-ohda. interestingly, pre-treatment with desipramine prior to injection of 6-ohda, which is commonly used to preserve noradrenaline neurons, did not modify the effect of the lesion on depressive- and anxiety-like behaviors. thus, in the present model, mood-related conditions are independent of the reduction of noradrenaline caused by 6-ohda. based on these findings we propose that the anti-depressive and anxiolytic action of reboxetine is mediated by promoting dopamine transmission through blockade of dopamine uptake from residual noradrenergic terminals.",Bonito-Oliva A,2014,Front Behav Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2014.00290,25221486,Bonito-Oliva A; Masini D; Fisone G,article,D016428: Journal Article,,,,https://openalex.org/W2104239201,131,18,1,1993,324,13

false,invading parasitoids suffer no allee effect: a manipulative field experiment,"one frequent explanation for the failure of biological invasions is the allee effect: due to positive density dependence, initially small invading populations may fail to establish and spread. populations released for biological control are similar to fortuitous invading populations and may therefore suffer from allee effects. however, unlike fortuitous invasions, biological control allows the experimental manipulation of initial population size and, thus, offers a unique opportunity to test for the occurrence of allee effects. we manipulated the initial size of 45 populations of a parasitoid wasp introduced for the biological control of a phytophagous insect and followed the population dynamics of both parasitoids and hosts during three years. our results suggest an absence of allee effects but clear negative density dependence instead: (1) the probability of establishment after three years was not affected by initial population size; (2) net reproductive rate was highest at low parasitoid density and high host density; (3) the sex ratio, reflecting the proportion of virgin females, did not increase at low density, suggesting that low densities did not impede mate-finding; (4) the depression of host populations did not depend upon the number of parasitoids introduced. this is, to our knowledge, the first experimental test of the allee effect in an invading parasitoid. it leads us to propose that a number of behavioral and life-history features of many parasitoids could protect them from allee effects.",Fauvergue X,2007,Ecology,https://doi.org/10.1890/06-1238.1,17918416,Fauvergue X; Malausa JC; Giuge L; Courchamp F,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D017753: Ecosystem; D006430: Hemiptera; D008954: Models, Biological; D011156: Population Density; D011157: Population Dynamics; D011158: Population Growth; D011235: Predatory Behavior; D014863: Wasps",,,https://openalex.org/W2130434144,76,11,1,1527,259,7

false,peripheral versus central cardiorespiratory effects of morphine,"the administration of morphine sulfate (ms, 2 mg/kg) into the right atrium in decerebrate rats, produced a dramatic bradycardia, apnea, and a slight transient biphasic blood pressure response within 1 sec. the bradycardia was slowly restored to control levels within 8–10 min and was prevented by pretreatment with atropine. apnea (7.3 ± 2.2 sec) was followed by a period of rapid shallow breathing. acute tolerance to these effects developed to subsequent doses of morphine. in paralyzed artificially ventilated animals, morphine produced: (1) cessation of phrenic nerve (pn) activity which was followed by bursts of shortened duration; and (2) concomitant excitation of the recurrent laryngeal nerve (rln), this activity exhibited a continuous discharge which was asynchronous with that of phrenic nerve. these actions of morphine were qualitatively similar to those observed with phenyldiguanide (pdg) and were found to be reflexogenic, i.e. emanating from the lungs via stimulation of pulmonary c-fibers. bilaterally vagotomized animals only responded to morphine with respiratory depression, characterized by a severe decrease in respiratory rate and minute ventilation. on the other hand, animals with intact vagi showed stimulation of rate and minute ventilation following a brief period of apnea. they were less sensitive than vagotomized animals to the depressant action during the first 8 min after administration of morphine. all the effects of morphine were blocked by pretreatment with naloxone (50–400 μg/kg, i.v.). these results indicate that the initial cardiorespiratory effects of morphine are due to a peripheral reflex action arising from the stimulation of opiate receptors associated with pulmonary c-fibers, e.g. j-fibers.",Willette RN,1982,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/0028-3908(82)90116-2,6292766,Willette RN; Sapru HN,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D002319: Cardiovascular System; D006339: Heart Rate; D008168: Lung; D008297: Male; D009020: Morphine; D010525: Peripheral Nerves; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains; D011957: Receptors, Opioid; D012018: Reflex; D012119: Respiration; D014630: Vagus Nerve",,,https://openalex.org/W2076211204,63,7,1,1745,297,13
false,a novel family of negative and positive allosteric modulators of nmda receptors,"the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptor family regulates various central nervous system functions, such as synaptic plasticity. however, hypo- or hyperactivation of nmda receptors is critically involved in many neurological and psychiatric conditions, such as pain, stroke, epilepsy, neurodegeneration, schizophrenia, and depression. consequently, subtype-selective positive and negative modulators of nmda receptor function have many potential therapeutic applications not addressed by currently available compounds. we have identified allosteric modulators with several novel patterns of nmda receptor subtype selectivity that have a novel mechanism of action. in a series of carboxylated naphthalene and phenanthrene derivatives, compounds were identified that selectively potentiate responses at glun1/glun2a [e.g., 9-iodophenanthrene-3-carboxylic acid (ubp512)]; glun1/glun2a and glun1/glun2b [9-cyclopropylphenanthrene-3-carboxylic acid (ubp710)]; glun1/glun2d [3,5-dihydroxynaphthalene-2-carboxylic acid (ubp551)]; or glun1/glun2c and glun1/glun2d receptors [6-, 7-, 8-, and 9-nitro isomers of naphth[1,2-c][1,2,5]oxadiazole-5-sulfonic acid (nsc339614)] and have no effect or inhibit responses at the other nmda receptors. selective inhibition was also observed; ubp512 inhibits only glun1/glun2c and glun1/glun2d receptors, whereas 6-bromo-2-oxo-2h-chromene-3-carboxylic acid (ubp608) inhibits glun1/glun2a receptors with a 23-fold selectivity compared with glun1/glun2d receptors. the actions of these compounds were not competitive with the agonists l-glutamate or glycine and were not voltage-dependent. whereas the n-terminal regulatory domain was not necessary for activity of either potentiators or inhibitors, segment 2 of the agonist ligand-binding domain was important for potentiating activity, whereas subtype-specific inhibitory activity was dependent upon segment 1. in terms of chemical structure, activity profile, and mechanism of action, these modulators represent a new class of pharmacological agents for the study of nmda receptor subtype function and provide novel lead compounds for a variety of neurological disorders.",Costa BM,2010,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.110.174144,20858708,Costa BM; Irvine MW; Fang G; Eaves RJ; Mayo-Martin MB; Skifter DA; Jane DE; Monaghan DT,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000494: Allosteric Regulation; D000818: Animals; D001665: Binding Sites; D001667: Binding, Competitive; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D005998: Glycine; D006801: Humans; D049990: Membrane Transport Modulators; D009865: Oocytes; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D017434: Protein Structure, Tertiary; D018075: RNA, Complementary; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D011993: Recombinant Fusion Proteins; D017384: Sequence Deletion; D014982: Xenopus laevis",,,https://openalex.org/W2142479105,79,12,1,2171,343,9

false,interhemispheric difference in susceptibility to epileptogenesis: evidence from the audiogenic kindling model in wistar rats,"audiogenic kindling (ak) represents a model of naturally occurring epileptogenesis in which intensification of repeatedly induced audiogenic seizures results from propagation of epileptic activity from the brainstem to forebrain. previously it has been shown that unilateral cortical spreading depression (sd) is a reliable earliest manifestation of mild ak produced by repetition of minimal audiogenic seizures (running) in wistar rats. the unilateral triggering sd suggests the existence of asymmetry in the forebrain recruitment during the kindling and the present study examined whether epileptogenesis produced by this mild ak paradigm is a lateralized process. twenty five running episodes were induced by brief sound stimulation in wistar rats susceptible to audiogenic seizures. behavioral and eeg correlates of ak development were assessed. running behavior elicited by brief sound stimulation had an asymmetrical pattern with profound preference for one direction. most rats expressing leftward running displayed full kindling development whereas the majority of rats with rightward running were resistant to ak. the eeg marker of ak, a cortical epileptiform discharge, was recorded only in rats with leftward running and the first discharge appeared in the left cortex. cortical sd was recorded after repeated running seizures in all rats with reproducible audiogenic response irrespective of the running lateralization and propensity to kindling. until the late kindling stages, sd was triggered unilaterally in the cortex ipsilateral to the running direction. these findings indicate intrinsically determined lateralization of epileptogenic process in the mild ak model and enhanced vulnerability of the left hemisphere to epileptogenesis.",Vinogradova LV,2010,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2010.03.037,20303340,Vinogradova LV,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000161: Acoustic Stimulation; D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D013181: Cortical Spreading Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004569: Electroencephalography; D007839: Functional Laterality; D007696: Kindling, Neurologic; D008297: Male; D009483: Neuropsychological Tests; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D012420: Running; D012640: Seizures",,,https://openalex.org/W2043038501,124,16,1,1752,266,11
false,effect of nitric oxide synthesis inhibition on post-occlusive choroidal blood flow in rats,"experiments were designed to study involvement of nitric oxide on vascular responses to ocular ischemia in the anesthetized rat. anterior choroidal blood flow was measured using laser-doppler flowmetry. in some experiments, cerebral cortical blood flow also was measured. ischemia was produced by either occlusion of the cephalic blood supply or more locally via a ligature tightened around the eye stalk. arterial blood pressure and choroidal blood flow was continuously measured before, during and after a 20 min ischemic challenge. both methods of ischemia reduced choroidal blood flow (>90%) with no consistent ocular hyperemia seen upon reperfusion. no significant differences in response pattern between the two ischemia techniques were apparent. treatment with the non-selective inhibitor of nitric oxide (l-name 2 mg/kg, i.v.) did not alter either basal choroidal blood flow or the pattern of reperfusion. a larger dose of l-name (50 mg/kg, i.v.) reduced both basal choroidal blood flow and the final reperfusion level (most likely due to continued depression of the basal ocular choroidal blood flow). neither d-name nor the neuronal nitric oxide synthase inhibitor, 7-nitroindazole, altered basal anterior choroidal blood flow or the reperfusion pattern seen after reperfusion. the results confirm our previous observations that inhibition of endothelial nitric oxide lowers. basal choroidal blood flow in the rat eye. however, in contrast to the cerebral circulation where l-name greatly attenuates initial reperfusion to the cerebral cortex, inhibition of nitric oxide synthase does not appear to notably further influence anterior choroidal reperfusion.",Koss MC,2000,J Ocul Pharmacol Ther,https://doi.org/10.1089/jop.2000.16.55,10673132,Koss MC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002540: Cerebral Cortex; D002829: Choroid; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D007191: Indazoles; D007511: Ischemia; D017078: Laser-Doppler Flowmetry; D008026: Ligation; D008297: Male; D019331: NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; D009569: Nitric Oxide; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2061655761,90,13,1,1666,275,15
false,role of ampa receptor trafficking in nmda receptor‐dependent synaptic plasticity in the rat lateral amygdala,"abstract stimulated exocytosis and endocytosis of post‐synaptic α‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid subtype of glutamate receptors (ampars) have been proposed as primary mechanisms for the expression of hippocampal ca1 long‐term potentiation (ltp) and long‐term depression (ltd), respectively. ltp and ltd, the two most well characterized forms of synaptic plasticity, are thought to be important for learning and memory in behaving animals. both ltp and ltd can also be induced in the lateral amygdala (la), a critical structure involved in fear conditioning. however, the role of ampar trafficking in the expression of either ltp or ltd in this structure remains unclear. in this study, we show that nmda receptor‐dependent ltp and ltd can be reliably induced at the synapses of the auditory thalamic inputs to the la in brain slices. the expression of ltp was prevented by post‐synaptic blockade of vesicle‐mediated exocytosis with application of a light chain of clostridium tetanus neurotoxin and was associated with increased cell‐surface ampar expression. in contrast, the expression of ltd was prevented by post‐synaptic application of a glutamate receptor 2‐derived interference peptide, which specifically blocks the stimulated clathrin‐dependent endocytosis of ampars, and was correlated with a reduction in plasma membrane‐surface expression of ampars. these results strongly suggest that regulated trafficking of post‐synaptic ampars is also involved in the expression of ltp and ltd in the la.",Yu SY,2008,J Neurochem,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1471-4159.2008.05461.x,18466342,Yu SY; Wu DC; Liu L; Ge Y; Wang YT,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D015763: 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate; D000679: Amygdala; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D001640: Bicuculline; D019921: Biotinylation; D004307: Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D004705: Endocytosis; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018756: GABA Antagonists; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D008297: Male; D009474: Neurons; D021381: Protein Transport; D051381: Rats; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D013569: Synapses",,,https://openalex.org/W2058083646,108,15,1,1524,243,8

false,nociceptin/orphanin fq (n/ofq) inhibits excitatory and inhibitory synaptic signaling in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn),"environmental synchronization of the endogenous mammalian circadian rhythm involves glutamatergic and gabaergic neurotransmission within the hypothalamic suprachiasmatic nucleus (scn). the neuropeptide nociceptin/orphanin fq (n/ofq) inhibits light-induced phase shifts, evokes k+-currents and reduces the intracellular ca2+ concentration in scn neurons. since these effects are consistent with a modulatory role for n/ofq on synaptic transmission in the scn, we examined the effects of n/ofq on evoked and spontaneous excitatory and inhibitory currents in the scn. n/ofq produced a consistent concentration-dependent inhibition of glutamate-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (epsc) evoked by optic nerve stimulation. n/ofq did not alter the amplitude of currents induced by application of (rs)-α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (ampa) or n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) nor the amplitude of miniature epsc (mepsc) consistent with a lack of n/ofq effect on postsynaptic ampa or nmda receptors. n/ofq significantly reduced the mepsc frequency. the inhibitory actions of n/ofq were blocked by ω-conotoxin gvia, an n-type ca2+channel antagonist and partially blocked by ω-agatoxin tk, a p/q type ca2+ channel blocker. these data indicate that n/ofq reduces evoked epsc, in part, by inhibiting the activity of n- and p/q-type ca2+ channels. in addition, n/ofq produced a consistent reduction in baseline ca2+ levels in presynaptic retinohypothalamic tract terminals. n/ofq also inhibited evoked gabaa receptor-mediated inhibitory postsynaptic currents (ipsc) in a concentration dependent manner. however, n/ofq had no effect on currents activated by muscimol application or on the amplitude of miniature ipsc (mipsc) and significantly reduced the mipsc frequency consistent with an inhibition of gaba release downstream from ca2+ entry. finally, n/ofq inhibited the paired-pulse depression observed in scn gabaergic synapses consistent with a presynaptic mechanism of action. together these results suggest a widespread modulatory role for n/ofq on the synaptic transmission in the scn.",Gompf HS,2005,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2004.11.057,15857701,Gompf HS; Moldavan MG; Irwin RP; Allen CN,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D015220: Calcium Channels; D002940: Circadian Rhythm; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D008297: Male; D018847: Opioid Peptides; D009924: Organ Culture Techniques; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D018079: Receptors, GABA; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D013493: Suprachiasmatic Nucleus; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D000097629: Nociceptin",,,https://openalex.org/W2012901463,121,18,1,2104,323,13

true,antipsychotics possessing antidepressive efficacy increase golf protein in rat striatum,"introduction: recently, second-generation antipsychotics (sgas) have been widely used in the treatment of mood disorders. however, the mechanisms of the antidepressant effect of sgas remain unclear. we proposed that golf protein, a stimulant alpha-subunit of g protein coupled with the dopamine d1 receptor, might a play the key role in the antidepressive effect of antidepressants. to clarify the relationship between golf protein and the antidepressive effects of antipsychotics, we examined the effects of chronic treatment with several antipsychotics on the level of golf protein in the rat striatum.
materials and methods: male wistar rats were treated with one of several antipsychotics for 2 weeks: olanzapine (2, 5, or 10 mg/kg), sulpiride (5, 10, or 50 mg/kg), amisulpride (3, 10, or 20 mg/kg), risperidone (0.2 or 2 mg/kg), haloperidol (0.3 or 3 mg/kg), or clozapine (2 or 10 mg/kg).
results and discussion: olanzapine (5 mg/kg), sulpiride (5, or 10 mg/kg), and amisulpride (10 mg/kg) treatments significantly increased the level of golf protein, but there was no increase with administration of higher doses of these three antipsychotics. risperidone, haloperidol, and clozapine treatment did not change the level of golf protein at any dose. in this study, all antipsychotics that have antidepressive effects increased golf protein. this suggests that an increase in golf may play an important role in the antidepressive effect of antipsychotics.
conclusion: we postulate that the increase in golf protein levels result in an increase the proportion of d1 receptors in the high-affinity state and that augmentation of the dopaminergic system exerts the antidepressant effect.",Taoka H,2008,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-008-1264-y,18777019,Taoka H; Hamamura T; Endo S; Miyata S; Toma K; Ishihara T; Kuroda S,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000077582: Amisulpride; D000818: Animals; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D015153: Blotting, Western; D003024: Clozapine; D003342: Corpus Striatum; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D044385: GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits; D006220: Haloperidol; D007274: Injections, Intraperitoneal; D008297: Male; D000077152: Olanzapine; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D018967: Risperidone; D013469: Sulpiride; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2007284121,87,10,1,1690,313,10

false,histone deacetylases control neurogenesis in embryonic brain by inhibition of bmp2/4 signaling,"histone-modifying enzymes are essential for a wide variety of cellular processes dependent upon changes in gene expression. histone deacetylases (hdacs) lead to the compaction of chromatin and subsequent silencing of gene transcription, and they have recently been implicated in a diversity of functions and dysfunctions in the postnatal and adult brain including ocular dominance plasticity, memory consolidation, drug addiction, and depression. here we investigate the role of hdacs in the generation of neurons and astrocytes in the embryonic brain.as a variety of hdacs are expressed in differentiating neural progenitor cells, we have taken a pharmacological approach to inhibit multiple family members. inhibition of class i and ii hdacs in developing mouse embryos with trichostatin a resulted in a dramatic reduction in neurogenesis in the ganglionic eminences and a modest increase in neurogenesis in the cortex. an identical effect was observed upon pharmacological inhibition of hdacs in in vitro-differentiating neural precursors derived from the same brain regions. a reduction in neurogenesis in ganglionic eminence-derived neural precursors was accompanied by an increase in the production of immature astrocytes. we show that hdacs control neurogenesis by inhibition of the bone morphogenetic protein bmp2/4 signaling pathway in radial glial cells. hdacs function at the transcriptional level by inhibiting and promoting, respectively, the expression of bmp2 and smad7, an intracellular inhibitor of bmp signaling. inhibition of the bmp2/4 signaling pathway restored normal levels of neurogenesis and astrogliogenesis to both ganglionic eminence- and cortex-derived cultures in which hdacs were inhibited.our results demonstrate a transcriptionally-based regulation of bmp2/4 signaling by hdacs both in vivo and in vitro that is critical for neurogenesis in the ganglionic eminences and that modulates cortical neurogenesis. the results also suggest that hdacs may regulate the developmental switch from neurogenesis to astrogliogenesis that occurs in late gestation.",Shakèd M,2008,PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0002668,18628975,Shakèd M; Weissmüller K; Svoboda H; Hortschansky P; Nishino N; Wölfl S; Tucker KL,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001253: Astrocytes; D055396: Bone Morphogenetic Protein 2; D055415: Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4; D019485: Bone Morphogenetic Proteins; D001921: Brain; D002843: Chromatin; D018507: Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; D006655: Histone Deacetylases; D006877: Hydroxamic Acids; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D008808: Mice, Inbred CBA; D008954: Models, Biological; D009474: Neurons; D015398: Signal Transduction; D016212: Transforming Growth Factor beta",,,https://openalex.org/W2037878697,94,12,1,2083,314,10

false,frequency‐dependent recruitment of inhibition mediated by stellate cells in the rat cerebellar cortex,"in the cerebellum, dendritic inhibition of purkinje cells (pcs) is mediated by stellate cells (scs). these inhibitory interneurons are critically involved in the cerebellar network; they control the timing and firing frequency of pcs, the only output cells of the cerebellar cortex. however, the underlying properties of parallel fiber (pf) to sc excitatory synapses have not been fully determined. to characterize the conditions favoring the recruitment of scs in the cerebellum, we analyzed evoked and spontaneous excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs) recorded from scs of rat cerebellar slices. we found that sc epscs evoked with single suprathreshold-intensity stimulations were mostly unitary, with a large amplitude and variable latencies, and failed with a high rate. increasing the frequency of stimulation above 60 hz significantly reduced failures, whereas mean sc epsc amplitude was increased by less than 20%. decreasing failures at pf-sc synapses experimentally enhanced the number of asynchronous sc epscs per stimulation but, again, moderately increased the mean sc epsc amplitude. finally, brief presynaptic bursts transiently depressed synaptic transmission. this depression resulted from the release of endocannabinoids and might act as a negative-feedback mechanism. thus, we conclude that sc epscs evoked with single suprathreshold-intensity stimulations are mostly unitary and that pf-sc synapse efficacy is highly regulated by the presynaptic temporal pattern of activity and the frequency of afferent inputs. such synaptic properties may control the responsiveness of sc synapses to the frequency of pf stimulations, which may control the spatial extent and duration of the recruitment of inhibition in the cerebellar cortex.",Rancillac A,2005,J Neurosci Res,https://doi.org/10.1002/jnr.20473,15789412,Rancillac A; Barbara JG,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D063385: Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators; D002525: Cerebellar Cortex; D003712: Dendrites; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D007395: Interneurons; D008297: Male; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009434: Neural Pathways; D009924: Organ Culture Techniques; D017729: Presynaptic Terminals; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2171612250,101,13,1,1751,283,11
false,calcium time course as a signal for spike-timing–dependent plasticity,"calcium has been proposed as a postsynaptic signal underlying synaptic spike-timing-dependent plasticity (stdp). we examine this hypothesis with computational modeling based on experimental results from hippocampal cultures, some of which are presented here, in which pairs and triplets of pre- and postsynaptic spikes induce potentiation and depression in a temporally asymmetric way. specifically, we present a set of model biochemical detectors, based on plausible molecular pathways, which make direct use of the time course of the calcium signal to reproduce these experimental stdp results. our model features a modular structure, in which long-term potentiation (ltp) and depression (ltd) components compete to determine final plasticity outcomes; one aspect of this competition is a veto through which appropriate calcium time courses suppress ltd. simulations of our model are also shown to be consistent with classical ltp and ltd induced by several presynaptic stimulation paradigms. overall, our results provide computational evidence that, while the postsynaptic calcium time course contains sufficient information to distinguish various experimental long-term plasticity paradigms, small changes in the properties of back-propagation of action potentials or in synaptic dynamics can alter the calcium time course in ways that will significantly affect stdp induction by any detector based exclusively on postsynaptic calcium. this may account for the variability of stdp outcomes seen within hippocampal cultures, under repeated application of a single experimental protocol, as well as for that seen in multiple spike experiments across different systems.",Rubin JE,2005,J Neurophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00803.2004,15625097,Rubin JE; Gerkin RC; Bi GQ; Chow CC,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002118: Calcium; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D004622: Embryo, Mammalian; D006624: Hippocampus; D008959: Models, Neurological; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D009474: Neurons; D051381: Rats; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2143007771,69,9,1,1670,259,6
false,dobutamine “stress” test and latent cardiac susceptibility to inhaled diesel exhaust in normal and hypertensive rats,"background: exercise “stress” testing is a screening tool used to determine the amount of stress for which the heart can compensate before developing abnormal rhythm or ischemia, particularly in susceptible persons. although this approach has been used to assess risk in humans exposed to air pollution, it has never been applied to rodent studies.objective: we hypothesized that a single exposure to diesel exhaust (de) would increase the risk of adverse cardiac events such as arrhythmia and myocardial ischemia in rats undergoing a dobutamine challenge test, which can be used to mimic exercise-like stress.methods: wistar-kyoto normotensive (wky) and spontaneously hypertensive (sh) rats implanted with radiotelemeters and a chronic intravenous catheter were whole-body exposed to 150 μg/m3 de for 4 hr. increasing doses of dobutamine, a β1-adrenergic agonist, were administered to conscious unrestrained rats 24 hr later to elicit the cardiac response observed during exercise while heart rate (hr) and electrocardiogram (ecg) were monitored.results: a single exposure to de potentiated the hr response of wky and sh rats during dobutamine challenge and prevented hr recovery at rest. during peak challenge, de-exposed sh rats had lower overall hr variability when compared with controls, in addition to transient st depression. all de-exposed animals also had increased arrhythmias.conclusions: these results are the first evidence that rats exhibit stress-induced cardiac dysrhythmia and ischemia sensitivity comparable to humans after a single exposure to a toxic air pollutant, particularly when in the presence of underlying cardiovascular disease. thus, exposure to low concentrations of air pollution can impair the heart’s ability to respond to stress and increase the risk of subsequent triggered dysfunction.",Hazari MS,2012,Environ Health Perspect,https://doi.org/10.1289/ehp.1104684,22543081,Hazari MS; Callaway J; Winsett DW; Lamb C; Haykal-Coates N; Krantz QT; King C; Costa DL; Farraj AK,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D004280: Dobutamine; D004562: Electrocardiography; D005080: Exercise Test; D006321: Heart; D006339: Heart Rate; D051381: Rats; D011918: Rats, Inbred SHR; D011921: Rats, Inbred WKY; D012119: Respiration; D001335: Vehicle Emissions",,,https://openalex.org/W1970628394,116,18,1,1823,298,6

false,changes in saccharin preference behavior as a primary outcome to evaluate pain and analgesia in acetic acid-induced visceral pain in mice,"reflex-based procedures are important measures in preclinical pain studies that evaluate stimulated behaviors. these procedures, however, are insufficient to capture the complexity of the pain experience, which is often associated with the depression of several innate behaviors. while recent studies have made efforts to evidence the suppression of some positively motivated behaviors in certain pain models, they are still far from being routinely used as readouts for analgesic screening. here, we characterized and compared the effect of the analgesic ibuprofen (ibu) and the stimulant, caffeine, in assays of acute pain-stimulated and pain-depressed behavior. intraperitoneal injection of acetic acid (aa) served as a noxious stimulus to stimulate a writhing response or depress saccharin preference and locomotor activity (lma) in mice. aa injection caused the maximum number of writhes between 5 and 20 minutes after administration, and writhing almost disappeared 1 hour later. aa-treated mice showed signs of depression-like behaviors after writhing resolution, as evidenced by reduced locomotion and saccharin preference for at least 4 and 6 hours, respectively. depression-like behaviors resolved within 24 hours after aa administration. a dose of ibu (40 mg/kg) - inactive to reduce aa-induced abdominal writhing - administered before or after aa injection significantly reverted pain-induced saccharin preference deficit. the same dose of ibu also significantly reverted the aa-depressed lma, but only when it was administered after aa injection. caffeine restored locomotion - but not saccharin preference - in aa-treated mice, thus suggesting that the reduction in saccharin preference - but not in locomotion - was specifically sensitive to analgesics. in conclusion, aa-induced acute pain attenuated saccharin preference and lma beyond the resolution of writhing behavior, and the changes in the expression of hedonic behavior, such as sweet taste preference, can be used as a more sensitive and translational model to evaluate analgesics.",de la Puente B,2015,J Pain Res,https://doi.org/10.2147/jpr.s91230,26504405,de la Puente B; Romero-Alejo E; Vela JM; Merlos M; Zamanillo D; Portillo-Salido E,article,D016428: Journal Article,,,,https://openalex.org/W1837941841,137,21,1,2056,332,12
false,effects of ethylenediamine – a putative gaba-releasing agent – on rat hippocampal slices and neocortical activity in vivo,"the simple diamine diaminoethane (ethylenediamine, eda) has been shown to activate gaba receptors in the central and peripheral nervous systems, partly by a direct action and partly by releasing endogenous gaba. these effects have been shown to be produced by the complexation of eda with bicarbonate to form a carbamate. the present work has compared eda, gaba and β-alanine responses in rat ca1 neurons using extracellular and intracellular recordings, as well as neocortical evoked potentials in vivo. superfusion of gaba onto hippocampal slices produced depolarisation and a decrease of field epsps, both effects fading rapidly, but showing sensitivity to blockade by bicuculline. eda produced an initial hyperpolarisation and increase of extracellular field epsp size with no fade and only partial sensitivity to bicuculline, with subsequent depolarisation, while β-alanine produces a much larger underlying hyperpolarisation and increase in fepsps, followed by depolarisation and inhibition of fepsps. the responses to β-alanine, but not gaba or eda, were blocked by strychnine. in vivo experiments, recording somatosensory evoked potentials, confirmed that eda produced an initial increase followed by depression, and that this effect was not fully blocked by bicuculline. overall the results indicate that eda has actions in addition to the activation of gaba receptors. these actions are not attributable to activation of β-alanine-sensitive glycine receptors, but may involve the activation of sites sensitive to adipic acid, which is structurally equivalent to the dicarbamate of eda. the results emphasise the complex pharmacology of simple amines in bicarbonate-containing solutions.",Stone TW,2011,Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejphar.2010.10.061,21050846,Stone TW; Lui C; Addae JI,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000272: Adipates; D000818: Animals; D001639: Bicarbonates; D001640: Bicuculline; D005029: Ethylenediamines; D005073: Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018682: GABA Agents; D006624: Hippocampus; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008297: Male; D019579: Neocortex; D009474: Neurons; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D015091: beta-Alanine; D005680: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W2078264822,121,18,1,1696,272,10

false,biphasic metabolic rate trajectory of pupal diapause termination and post-diapause development in a tephritid fly,"metabolic depression is a highly conserved feature of insect diapause, and an increase in metabolism is a reliable indicator of diapause termination and the initiation of post-diapause development. the trajectory of metabolic rate following diapause termination can guide the identification of important physiological and developmental landmarks during this developmental transition, yet quantitative descriptions of these trajectories are relatively rare. here we track changes in metabolic rate from diapause through diapause termination and pharate adult development in rhagoletis pomonella (diptera: tephritidae), a univoltine tephritid fly that diapauses in the pupal stage. using respirometric monitoring we show that diapause termination and subsequent pharate adult development is characterized by a biphasic increase in metabolic rate. respiration rate initially increases logistically, reaching a plateau that is followed by a final, exponential increase terminating in adult eclosion. we develop a non-linear model describing this pattern with easily interpretable landmarks, and we map visible landmarks of morphogenesis onto the trajectory. the bulk of visible morphogenesis in pharate adult development occurs relatively late in the trajectory during the final, exponential phase, that matches the u-shaped trajectory of non-diapause individuals. these results mirror a qualitative description of the same trajectories of diapause and non-diapause flesh flies (sarcophaga). overall, our results suggest that (1) the course of diapause breakage and post-diapause development may be evolutionarily conserved in higher flies with pupal diapause, and (2) the biphasic trajectory is distinct from a more continuous trajectory observed during direct development.",Ragland GJ,2009,J Insect Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jinsphys.2008.12.013,19200436,Ragland GJ; Fuller J; Feder JL; Hahn DA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D002245: Carbon Dioxide; D004734: Energy Metabolism; D008675: Metamorphosis, Biological; D008954: Models, Biological; D009024: Morphogenesis; D011679: Pupa; D033621: Tephritidae",,,https://openalex.org/W2135452288,113,15,1,1770,267,9

false,reinforcement learning by hebbian synapses with adaptive thresholds,"a central problem in learning theory is how the vertebrate brain processes reinforcing stimuli in order to master complex sensorimotor tasks. this problem belongs to the domain of supervised learning, in which errors in the response of a neural network serve as the basis for modification of synaptic connectivity in the network and thereby train it on a computational task. the model presented here shows how a reinforcing feedback can modify synapses in a neuronal network according to the principles of hebbian learning. the reinforcing feedback steers synapses towards long-term potentiation or depression by critically influencing the rise in postsynaptic calcium, in accordance with findings on synaptic plasticity in mammalian brain. an important feature of the model is the dependence of modification thresholds on the previous history of reinforcing feedback processed by the network. the learning algorithm trained networks successfully on a task in which a population vector in the motor output was required to match a sensory stimulus vector presented shortly before. in another task, networks were trained to compute coordinate transformations by combining different visual inputs. the model continued to behave well when simplified units were replaced by single-compartment neurons equipped with several conductances and operating in continuous time. this novel form of reinforcement learning incorporates essential properties of hebbian synaptic plasticity and thereby shows that supervised learning can be accomplished by a learning rule similar to those used in physiologically plausible models of unsupervised learning. the model can be crudely correlated to the anatomy and electrophysiology of the amygdala, prefrontal and cingulate cortex and has predictive implications for further experiments on synaptic plasticity and learning processes mediated by these areas.",Pennartz CM,1997,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0306-4522(97)00118-8,9300423,Pennartz CM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000222: Adaptation, Physiological; D000818: Animals; D007858: Learning; D008959: Models, Neurological; D012054: Reinforcement, Psychology; D013569: Synapses",,,https://openalex.org/W2142732717,67,8,1,1886,287,10

true,reduced 5-ht1a- and gababreceptor function in dorsal raphé neurons upon chronic fluoxetine treatment of socially stressed rats,"autoinhibitory serotonin 1a receptors (5-ht 1a ) in dorsal raphé nucleus (drn) have been implicated in chronic depression and in actions of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssri). due to experimental limitations, it was never studied at single-cell level whether changes in 5-ht 1a receptor functionality occur in depression and during ssri treatment. here we address this question in a social stress paradigm in rats that mimics anhedonia, a core symptom of depression. we used whole cell patch-clamp recordings of 5-ht- and baclophen-induced g-protein-coupled inwardly rectifying potassium (girk) currents as a measure of 5-ht 1a - and gaba b receptor functionality. 5-ht 1a - and gaba b receptor-mediated girk-currents were not affected in socially stressed rats, suggesting that there was no abnormal (auto)inhibition in the drn on social stress. however, chronic fluoxetine treatment of socially stressed rats restored anticipatory behavior and reduced the responsiveness of 5-ht 1a receptor-mediated girk currents. because gaba b receptor-induced girk responses were also suppressed, fluoxetine does not appear to desensitize 5-ht 1a receptors but rather one of the downstream components shared with gaba b receptors. this fluoxetine effect on girk currents was also present in healthy animals and was independent of the animal's “depressed” state. thus our data show that symptoms of depression after social stress are not paralleled by changes in 5-ht 1a receptor signaling in drn neurons, but ssri treatment can alleviate these behavioral symptoms while acting strongly on the 5-ht 1a receptor signaling pathway.",Cornelisse LN,2007,J Neurophysiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/jn.00109.2007,17460100,Cornelisse LN; Van der Harst JE; Lodder JC; Baarendse PJ; Timmerman AJ; Mansvelder HD; Spruijt BM; Brussaard AB,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D001418: Baclofen; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004347: Drug Interactions; D005473: Fluoxetine; D051676: G Protein-Coupled Inwardly-Rectifying Potassium Channels; D018755: GABA Agonists; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008297: Male; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D009474: Neurons; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D011903: Raphe Nuclei; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D044282: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A; D018080: Receptors, GABA-B; D012701: Serotonin; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D013312: Stress, Physiological",,,https://openalex.org/W2159016014,148,33,1,1629,269,9

false,formulation and evaluation of niosomal nasal drug delivery system of folic acid for brain targeting,"nasal mucosa offers advantages to deliver drugs to brain via olfactory route thus provides rapid onset of drug action and hence faster therapeutic effect. therefore, various strategies have been proposed to improve the delivery of different drugs to brain including liposomes, colloidal drug carriers, micelles, chimeric peptide technology and nanotechnology through nasal route. the low blood level of folates is the primary cause of depression in alzheimer’s disease. folic acid is a water soluble vitamin showing difficulty in crossing the blood brain barrier and thus was formulated as niosomal nasal drug delivery systems to target the brain. in the present work, folic acid niosomes were prepared using different nonionic surfactants i.e., span 20, span 60, span 80, tween 20, tween 80 and cholesterol by using lipid layer hydration technique. these were evaluated for particle size, viscosity, osmotic shock, entrapment efficiency and in vitro drug release. the influence of different formulation variables such as surfactant type, surfactant concentration, and cholesterol concentration was optimized for required size distribution, viscosity, entrapment efficiency and in vitro release. the prepared niosomes were in the size range of 3.05–5.625µm. niosomes prepared with span 60 and cholesterol in the ratio of 1:1(50mg: 50mg) shown higher entrapment efficiency of 69.42% and better in vitro drug release of 64.2% at the end of 12 hrs and therefore considered as optimized formulation. the stability studies were carried out by storing niosomes at 4±1°c and 25±1°c and showed good stability over the period of storage. the release of drug from niosomes followed anomalous diffusion and obeyed first order release kinetics. ex-vivo perfusion studies were also performed by using rat model, about 48.15% of drug was found to be absorbed through nasal cavity at the end of 6 hrs. keywords: bbb, characterization, ex-vivo studies, folic acid niosomes, nasal delivery, olfactory region, optimization.",Ravouru N,2013,Curr Drug Discov Technol,https://doi.org/10.2174/15701638113109990031,23863098,Ravouru N; Kondreddy P; Korakanchi D; Haritha M,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000281: Administration, Intranasal; D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D002626: Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; D002784: Cholesterol; D016503: Drug Delivery Systems; D004355: Drug Stability; D005492: Folic Acid; D008081: Liposomes; D008297: Male; D009297: Nasal Mucosa; D009997: Osmotic Pressure; D010316: Particle Size; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013501: Surface-Active Agents; D014783: Viscosity; D014803: Vitamin B Complex",,,https://openalex.org/W2101635623,99,15,1,2005,347,13

false,"cyppa, a positive modulator of small-conductance ca2+-activated k+ channels, inhibits phasic uterine contractions and delays preterm birth in mice","organized uterine contractions, including those necessary for parturition, are dependent on calcium entry through voltage-gated calcium channels in myometrial smooth muscle cells. recent evidence suggests that small-conductance ca 2+ -activated potassium channels (k ca 2), specifically isoforms k ca 2.2 and 2.3, may control these contractions through negative feedback regulation of ca 2+ entry. we tested whether selective pharmacologic activation of k ca 2.2/2.3 channels might depress uterine contractions, providing a new strategy for preterm labor intervention. western blot analysis and immunofluorescence microscopy revealed expression of both k ca 2.2 and k ca 2.3 in the myometrium of nonpregnant (np) and pregnant (gestation day 10 and 16; d10 and d16, respectively) mice. spontaneous phasic contractions of isolated np, d10, and d16 uterine strips were all suppressed by the k ca 2.2/2.3-selective activator cyppa in a concentration-dependent manner. this effect was antagonized by the selective k ca 2 inhibitor apamin. whereas cyppa sensitivity was reduced in d10 and d16 versus np strips (pic 50 5.33 ± 0.09, 4.64 ± 0.03, 4.72 ± 0.10, respectively), all contractions were abolished between 30 and 60 μm. blunted contractions were associated with cyppa depression of spontaneous ca 2+ events in myometrial smooth muscle bundles. augmentation of uterine contractions with oxytocin or prostaglandin f 2α did not reduce cyppa sensitivity or efficacy. finally, in an ru486-induced preterm labor model, cyppa significantly delayed time to delivery by 3.4 h and caused a 2.5-fold increase in pup retention. these data indicate that pharmacologic stimulation of myometrial k ca 2.2/2.3 channels effectively suppresses ca 2+ -mediated uterine contractions and delays preterm birth in mice, supporting the potential utility of this approach in tocolytic therapies.",Skarra DV,2011,Am J Physiol Cell Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1152/ajpcell.00082.2011,21795518,Skarra DV; Cornwell T; Solodushko V; Brown A; Taylor MS,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000019: Abortifacient Agents; D000818: Animals; D001030: Apamin; D002118: Calcium; D015237: Dinoprost; D005260: Female; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D015735: Mifepristone; D009215: Myometrium; D007752: Obstetric Labor, Premature; D010121: Oxytocin; D024681: Potassium Channels, Calcium-Activated; D011247: Pregnancy; D047928: Premature Birth; D011720: Pyrazoles; D011743: Pyrimidines; D014590: Uterine Contraction",,,https://openalex.org/W2025334781,168,36,1,1870,310,11

true,reactivity of 5-ht1a receptor in adult rats after neonatal noradrenergic neurons' lesion — implications for antidepressant-like action,"the aim of this study was to assess the 5-ht1a receptor reactivity after neonatal noradrenergic neurons' lesion. dsp-4 (n-(2-chloroethyl)-n-ethyl-2-bromobenzylamine), 50 mg/kg, was administered 30 min after a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri)--zimelidine (10 mg/kg) on the 1st and 3rd day of life. zimelidine was used to prevent serotonin (5-ht) depletion. 5-ht1a autoreceptor is involved in the regulation of 5-ht release as well as the pathogenesis of depression. during a microdialysis study of anaesthetized rats, the 5-ht1a receptor agonist, r-(+)-8-oh-dpat (0.1 mg/kg), decreased 5-ht release in the medial prefrontal cortex of control rats but this effect was significantly attenuated in dsp-4-treated animals (10-12 weeks old). to further determine which type of receptor, either pre or postsynaptically located, is involved in the attenuated response to the 5-ht1a receptor agonist in lesioned rats, behavioral tests were conducted. in the forced swimming test, dsp-4 treated rats after saline injection, displayed shorter immobility time in comparison to control rats. r-(+)-8-oh-dpat (0.5 mg/kg) evoked an antidepressant-like effect in control and dsp-4 treated rats in a learned helplessness paradigm as well as the forced swimming test. the results of this study provided further support for the exclusive desensitization of 5-ht1a autoreceptor in adult rats with neonatal lesion of the central noradrenergic system.",Dabrowska J,2008,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2008.08.054,18789911,Dabrowska J; Nowak P; Brus R,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D017371: 8-Hydroxy-2-(di-n-propylamino)tetralin; D018663: Adrenergic Agents; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D001596: Benzylamines; D003863: Depression; D006380: Helplessness, Learned; D008297: Male; D009474: Neurons; D009638: Norepinephrine; D017397: Prefrontal Cortex; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D044282: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A; D012701: Serotonin; D058825: Serotonin 5-HT1 Receptor Agonists; D017366: Serotonin Receptor Agonists; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D013997: Time Factors; D015031: Zimeldine",,,https://openalex.org/W2072691912,134,18,1,1441,253,9
false,contribution of ca2+-influx to generation of the transient inward current in guinea-pig ventricular muscles.,"contribution of ca2+-influx via the slow channel to generation of the transient inward current in guinea-pig ventricular muscles was studied using a single sucrose gap voltage clamp technique. the transient inward current (ti) was induced from superfusion of the preparations with the low-k+ (0mm), high-ca2+ (3.6mm) solution. application of 2mm-co2+ quickly and reversibly suppressed the ti amplitude to 25% of the control and delayed its peak timing to 153% during 10-20min. inhibition developed as quickly as co2+ suppressed the slow inward current (is), and its recovery took place without apparent time lag behind its effect on is. the block of both ti and is by co2+ was antagonized by raising external ca2+ to 7.2mm. removal of external ca2+ caused a prompt suppression of both is and ti. application of 2 or 5mm-procaine hcl produced a complete abolition of ti with a mild depression of is. while 1mm-caffeic caused a suppression of ti after a transient augmentation, 10mm-caffeine completely eliminated it without abolishing is. these results indicate that the ca2+-influx through the slow channel acts not only to load the cell with those ions, but also to influence somehow the ca2+-release from the stores under the ca2+ -overloaded conditions.",Hiraoka M,1987,Jpn J Physiol,https://doi.org/10.2170/jjphysiol.37.479,2446033,Hiraoka M; Kawano S; Kinoshita H,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D002110: Caffeine; D002118: Calcium; D003035: Cobalt; D006168: Guinea Pigs; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007473: Ion Channels; D010210: Papillary Muscles; D011343: Procaine,,,https://openalex.org/W2033098582,108,15,1,1256,221,9

false,target‐cell‐specific bidirectional synaptic plasticity at hippocampal output synapses,"it is commonly accepted that the hippocampus is critically involved in the explicit memory formation of mammals. the subiculum is the principal target of ca1 pyramidal cells and thus serves as the major relay station for the outgoing hippocampal information. pyramidal cells in the subiculum can be classified according to their firing properties into burst-spiking and regular-spiking cells. in the present study we demonstrate that burst-spiking and regular-spiking cells show fundamentally different forms of low frequency-induced synaptic plasticity in rats. in burst-spiking cells, low-frequency stimulation (at 0.5-5 hz) induces frequency-dependent long-term depression (ltd) with a maximum at 1 hz. this ltd is dependent on the activation of nmdar and masks an mglur-dependent long-term potentiation (ltp). in contrast, in regular-spiking cells low-frequency stimulation induces an mglur-dependent ltp that masks an nmdar-dependent ltd. both processes depend on postsynaptic ca(2+)-signaling as bapta prevents the induction of synaptic plasticity in both cell types. thus, mglur-dependent ltp and nmdar-dependent ltd occur simultaneously at ca1-subiculum synapses and the predominant direction of synaptic plasticity relies on the cell type investigated. our data indicate a novel mechanism for the sliding-threshold model of synaptic plasticity, in which induction of ltp and ltd seems to be driven by the relative activation state of nmdar and mglur. our observation that the direction of synaptic plasticity correlates with the discharge properties of the postsynaptic cell reveals a novel and intriguing mechanism of target specificity that may serve in tuning the significance of neuronal information by trafficking hippocampal output onto either subicular burst-spiking or regular-spiking cells.",Fidzinski P,2008,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2008.06089.x,18312585,Fidzinski P; Shor O; Behr J,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D005260: Female; D006624: Hippocampus; D008297: Male; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013569: Synapses",,,https://openalex.org/W1972668816,85,8,1,1808,278,11
false,effects of halothane and isoflurane in the upper airway of dogs during development,"it has been previously found that volatile anesthetics significantly affect the activity of laryngeal receptors. in this study we have investigated the respiratory effects of these volatile anesthetics delivered into the upper airway of newborn and adult dogs. experiments were performed on 17 5-14-day-old, 3 26-28-day-old and 3 adult dogs, anesthetized and breathing spontaneously through a tracheostomy. in the youngest age group, halothane decreased ventilation (ve) to 37.6 +/- 6.8% of control (mean +/- se; p < 0.01) due to a decrease in both frequency and tidal volume. peak inspiratory and expiratory flows, and esophageal pressure (pes) were depressed also (60.8 +/- 6.5%, 51.6 +/- 7.1% and 66.5 +/- 8.1% of control, respectively; p < 0.01). superior laryngeal nerve (sln) section abolished the changes in ve, but residual significant decreases in peak flows and pes were still present and disappeared only after topical anesthetization of the nasal cavities. isoflurane had similar but weaker effects on ve (74.2 +/- 2.8% of control; p < 0.01), accompanied by a decrease in peak inspiratory and expiratory flows and pes. sln section abolished these changes. in the 26-28 day age group there was only a decrease in peak inspiratory airflow with the halothane challenge; isoflurane did not have any effect. in the adult dogs halothane caused only a marginal decrease in inspiratory time. the depressive effects of halothane and isoflurane should be considered when they are used for induction of anesthesia in newborns.",Sant'Ambrogio FB,1993,Respir Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/0034-5687(93)90102-g,8469847,Sant'Ambrogio FB; Anderson JW; Nishino T; Sant'Ambrogio G,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000367: Age Factors; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D004285: Dogs; D006221: Halothane; D007530: Isoflurane; D007823: Laryngeal Nerves; D007830: Larynx; D012119: Respiration; D015656: Respiratory Mechanics; D012143: Respiratory Physiological Phenomena; D012137: Respiratory System; D013990: Tidal Volume",,,https://openalex.org/W2033281458,82,13,1,1527,279,11

false,cortical gamma rhythms modulate nmdar-mediated spike timing dependent plasticity in a biophysical model,"spike timing dependent plasticity (stdp) has been observed experimentally in vitro and is a widely studied neural algorithm for synaptic modification. while the functional role of stdp has been investigated extensively, the effect of rhythms on the precise timing of stdp has not been characterized as well. we use a simplified biophysical model of a cortical network that generates pyramidal interneuronal gamma rhythms (ping). plasticity via stdp is investigated at the excitatory pyramidal cell synapse from a gamma frequency (30-90 hz) input independent of the network gamma rhythm. the input may represent a corticocortical or an information-specific thalamocortical connection. this synapse is mediated by n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor mediated (nmdar) currents. for distinct network and input frequencies, the model shows robust frequency regimes of potentiation and depression, providing a mechanism by which responses to certain inputs can potentiate while responses to other inputs depress. for potentiating regimes, the model suggests an optimal amount and duration of plasticity that can occur, which depends on the time course for the decay of the postsynaptic nmdar current. prolonging the duration of the input beyond this optimal time results in depression. inserting pauses in the input can increase the total potentiation. the optimal pause length corresponds to the decay time of the nmdar current. thus, stdp in this model provides a mechanism for potentiation and depression depending on input frequency and suggests that the slow nmdar current decay helps to regulate the optimal amplitude and duration of the plasticity. the optimal pause length is comparable to the time scale of the negative phase of a modulatory theta rhythm, which may pause gamma rhythm spiking. our pause results may suggest a novel role for this theta rhythm in plasticity. finally, we discuss our results in the context of auditory thalamocortical plasticity.",Lee S,2009,PLoS Comput Biol,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000602,20011119,Lee S; Sen K; Kopell N,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001303: Auditory Cortex; D004569: Electroencephalography; D005973: Glutamine; D008959: Models, Neurological; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",,,https://openalex.org/W1974425735,103,13,1,1957,325,15
false,evidence for an association between post-fledging dispersal and microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity in a large population of greater flamingos,"dispersal can be divided into three stages: departure, transience and settlement. despite the fact that theoretical studies have emphasized the importance of heterozygosity on dispersal strategies, empirical evidence of its effect on different stages of dispersal is lacking. here, using multi-event capture-mark-recapture models, we show a negative association between microsatellite multilocus heterozygosity (mlh; 10 loci; n = 1023) and post-fledging dispersal propensity for greater flamingos, phoenicopterus roseus, born in southern france. we propose that the negative effects of inbreeding depression affects competitive ability and therefore more homozygous individuals are more likely to disperse because they are less able to compete within the highly saturated natal site. finally, a model with the effect of mlh on propensity of post-fledgling dispersers to disperse to the long-distance sites of africa was equivalent to the null model, suggesting that mlh had low to no effect on dispersal distance. variations in individual genetic quality thus result in context-dependent heterogeneity in dispersal strategies at each stage of dispersal. our results have important implications on fitness since sites visited early in life are known to influence site selection later on in life and future survival.",Gillingham MA,2013,PLoS One,https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0081118,24278385,Gillingham MA; Cézilly F; Wattier R; Béchet A,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000465: Algorithms; D025041: Animal Migration; D000818: Animals; D001717: Birds; D005260: Female; D005602: France; D056426: Genetic Loci; D005843: Geography; D006579: Heterozygote; D008297: Male; D018895: Microsatellite Repeats; D008962: Models, Theoretical; D011157: Population Dynamics; D012621: Seasons",,,https://openalex.org/W1972415477,147,18,1,1314,208,7

false,further elucidation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive transmembrane signaling mechanism involved in central α2-adrenoceptor activation in the rat,"in adult male sprague-dawley rats anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium, we elucidated the molecular consequence of central alpha(2)-adrenoceptor activation. the hypotensive and negative chronotropic and inotropic actions of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptor agonist guanabenz were used as our experimental index. intracerebroventricular administration of pertussis toxin (2.5 &mgrg) significantly attenuated the cardiovascular suppressant effects of the aminoguanidine compound (100 &mgrg/kg i.v.). however, application of n-ethylmaleimide (0.125 or 0.250 &mgrg), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (1.25 or 2.50 &mgrg), cholera toxin (1.25 or 2.50 &mgrg) or forskolin (12.5 or 25.0 &mgrg) into the lateral cerebral ventricle elicited no appreciable blunting effect on the circulatory depression produced by guanabenz. these results were essentially duplicated when pertussis toxin (0.125 or 0.250 &mgrg), n-ethylmaleimide (0.0125 or 0.05 &mgrg), phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.125 or 0.25 &mgrg), cholera toxin (0.125 or 0.25 &mgrg) or forskolin (1.25 or 2.50 &mgrg) was microinjected bilaterally to the nucleus reticularis gigantocellularis, a medullary site believed to be intimately related to the antihypertensive action of guanabenz. these findings suggest that stimulation of the alpha(2)-adrenoceptors in the medulla oblongata may result in the activation of a pertussis toxin-sensitive gtp-binding regulatory protein. they further suggest that the biologic signals subsequent to this action may not be linked to gs, gi or gp but possibly go. copyright 1994 s. karger ag, basel",Chen CH,1994,J Biomed Sci,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf02258335,11725002,Chen CH; Lin KS; Chan SH,article,D016428: Journal Article,,,,https://openalex.org/W2024560903,142,17,1,1591,296,8
true,β-asarone reverses chronic unpredictable mild stress-induced depression-like behavior and promotes hippocampal neurogenesis in rats,"in this study, we investigated the influence of β-asarone, the major ingredient of acorus tatarinowii schott, on depressive-like behavior induced by the chronic unpredictable mild stresses (cums) paradigm and to clarify the underlying mechanisms. the results show that β-asarone treatment partially reversed the cums-induced depression-like behaviors in both the forced swim and sucrose preference tests. the behavioral effects were associated with increased hippocampal neurogenesis indicated by bromodeoxyuridine (brdu) immunoreactivity. β-asarone treatment significantly increased the expression of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) at levels of transcription and translation. moreover, cums caused significant reduction in erk1/2 and creb phosphorylation, both of which were partially attenuated by β-asarone administration. it is important to note that β-asarone treatment had no effect on total levels or phosphorylation state of any of the proteins examined in erk1/2-creb pathway in no stress rats, suggesting that β-asarone acts in a stress-dependent manner to block erk1/2-creb signaling. we did not observe a complete reversal of depression-like behaviors to control levels by β-asarone. to our knowledge, the present study is the first to demonstrate that adult neurogenesis is involved in the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of β-asarone, suggesting that β-asarone is a promising candidate for the treatment of depression.",Dong H,2014,Molecules,https://doi.org/10.3390/molecules19055634,24786848,Dong H; Gao Z; Rong H; Jin M; Zhang X,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000081248: Allylbenzene Derivatives; D000818: Animals; D000840: Anisoles; D019208: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; D003863: Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D006624: Hippocampus; D006801: Humans; D055495: Neurogenesis; D051381: Rats; D013550: Swimming",,,https://openalex.org/W2065947587,131,14,1,1449,219,8
false,oxytocin as a possible mediator of ssri-induced antidepressant effects,"the nonapeptide oxytocin is released into systemic circulation in situations of psychosocial interaction, and has been shown to be involved in mechanisms of social bonding and social recognition in laboratory studies. in view of disturbances in psychosocial relationships being a triggering factor for depression and anxiety, it is interesting to note that experimental studies have shown oxytocin to possess antidepressant- and anxiolytic-like actions. thus. in the present study we examined effects of the ssri citalopram (20 mg/kg i.p.) on plasma oxytocin, acutely and upon repeated administration, in adult male sprague-dawley rats. plasma oxytocin, and some functionally related peptides (cck, gastrin, somatostatin and insulin), were measured by standard radioimmunoassay techniques. acute citalopram administration produced a statistically significant increase in plasma oxytocin and cck levels. administration of citalopram for 14 days did not attenuate the oxytocin-releasing effect to a challenge dose of the ssri zimeldine (20 mg/kg s.c.), whereas cck levels were not increased after the subchronic citalopram treatment. thus, the ssri citalopram produces increased plasma oxytocin levels acutely, and there appears to be no or little tolerance to this effect upon repeated administration. there were no, or variable, effects on plasma levels of gastrin, somatostatin or insulin. it is suggested that oxytocin release is an important aspect of the pharmacological actions of ssris, and this could be an important contributory factor for the clinical profile of this group of antidepressants with particular efficacy in disorders of psychosocial origin.",Uvnäs-Moberg K,1999,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s002130050867,10102788,Uvnäs-Moberg K; Bjökstrand E; Hillegaart V; Ahlenius S,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D002766: Cholecystokinin; D015283: Citalopram; D005755: Gastrins; D007328: Insulin; D008297: Male; D010121: Oxytocin; D011863: Radioimmunoassay; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D013004: Somatostatin; D015031: Zimeldine",,,https://openalex.org/W2068250894,70,9,1,1663,269,11
true,synergistic antidepressant-like effect of the joint administration of caffeine and nmda receptor ligands in the forced swim test in mice,"the optimal treatment of depressed patients remains one of the most important challenges concerning depression. the identification of the best treatment strategies and development of new, safer, and more effective agents are crucial. the glutamatergic system seems to be a promising drug target, and consequently the use of the nmda receptor ligands, particularly in co-administration with other substances exerting the antidepressant activity, has emerged among the new ideas. the objective of this study was to examine the effect of caffeine on the performance of mice treated with various nmda modulators in the forced swim test. we demonstrated a significant interaction between caffeine (5 mg/kg) and the following nmda receptor ligands: mk-801 (an antagonist binding in the ion channel, 0.05 mg/kg), cgp 37849 (an antagonist of the glutamate site, 0.312 mg/kg), l-701,324 (an antagonist of the glycine site, 1 mg/kg), and d-cycloserine (a high-efficacy partial agonist of the glycine site, 2.5 mg/kg), while the interaction between caffeine and the inorganic modulators, i.e., zn(2+) (2.5 mg/kg) and mg(2+) (10 mg/kg), was not considered as significant. based on the obtained results, the simultaneous blockage of the adenosine and nmda receptors may be a promising target in the development of new antidepressants.",Serefko A,2016,J Neural Transm (Vienna),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-015-1467-4,26510772,Serefko A; Szopa A; Wlaź A; Wośko S; Wlaź P; Poleszak E,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D002110: Caffeine; D003863: Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D051379: Mice; D009043: Motor Activity; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D013315: Stress, Psychological",,,https://openalex.org/W2212056394,136,20,1,1321,242,6
false,endogenous nitric oxide release required for long-term synaptic depression in the cerebellum,"conjunctive stimulation of climbing and parallel fibres in the cerebellum evokes a long-term depression of parallel-fibre purkinje-cell transmission, a phenomenon implicated as the cellular mechanism for cerebellar motor learning. it is suspected that the increase in cyclic gmp concentration that occurs after activation of climbing fibres is required to evoke long-term depression. excitatory amino acids are known to cause the release of nitric oxide (no), resulting in elevation of the cgmp level in the cerebellum. here we report that endogenous no is released after stimulation of climbing fibres, that long-term depression evoked by conjunctive stimulation of parallel and climbing fibres is blocked by haemoglobin (which strongly binds no) or l-ng-monomethyl-arginine (an inhibitor of no synthase), and that exogenous no or cgmp can substitute for the stimulation of climbing fibres to cause long-term depression in rat cerebellar slices. these results demonstrate that the release of endogenous no is essential for the induction of synaptic plasticity in the cerebellum.",Shibuki K,1991,Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/349326a0,1702879,Shibuki K; Okada D,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D018750: 6-Cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione; D000594: Amino Acid Oxidoreductases; D000818: Animals; D001120: Arginine; D002531: Cerebellum; D006152: Cyclic GMP; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D004594: Electrophysiology; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D018698: Glutamic Acid; D006454: Hemoglobins; D008297: Male; D009569: Nitric Oxide; D019001: Nitric Oxide Synthase; D011188: Potassium; D011689: Purkinje Cells; D011725: Pyridines; D011810: Quinoxalines; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains; D013569: Synapses; D019323: omega-N-Methylarginine",,,https://openalex.org/W2085327871,92,12,1,1079,172,5
false,effect of maternal ethanol consumption on foetal and neonatal rat hepatic protein synthesis,"effects of maternal ethanol consumption were investigated on the rates of protein synthehsis by livers of foetal and neonatal rats both in vivo and in vitro, and on the activities of enzymes involved in protein synthesis and degradation. the rates of general protein synthesis by ribosomes in vitro studied by measuring the incorporation of [14c]leucine into ribosomal protein showed that maternal ethanol consumption resulted in an inhibition of the rates of protein synthesis by both foetal and neonatal livers from the ethanol-fed group. the rates of incorporation of intravenously injected [14c]leucine into hepatic proteins were also significantly lower in the foetal, neonatal and adult livers from the ethanol-fed group. incubation of adult-rat liver slices with ethanol resulted in an inhibition of the incorporation of [14c]leucine into hepatic proteins; however, this effect was not observed in the foetal liver slices. this effect of externally added ethanol was at least partially prevented by the addition of pyrazole to the adult liver slices. pyrazole addition to foetal liver slices was without significant effect on the rates of protein synthesis. cross-mixing experiments showed that the capacity of both hepatic ribosomes and ph5 enzyme fractions to synthesize proteins was decreased in the foetal liver from the ethanol-fed group. maternal ethanol consumption resulted in a decrease in hepatic total rna content, rna/dna ratio and ribosomal protein content in the foetal liver. foetal hepatic dna content was not significantly affected. ethanol consumption resulted in a significant decrease in proteolytic activity and the activity of tryptophan oxygenase in the foetal, neonatal and adult livers. it is possible that the mechanisms of inhibition of protein synthesis observed here in the foetal liver after maternal ethanol consumption may be responsible for at least some of the changes observed in ‘foetal alcohol syndrome’.",Rawat AK,1976,Biochem J,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj1600653,1016246,Rawat AK,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D000431: Ethanol; D005260: Female; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007930: Leucine; D008099: Liver; D008431: Maternal-Fetal Exchange; D011247: Pregnancy; D014176: Protein Biosynthesis; D051381: Rats; D012269: Ribosomal Proteins; D014366: Tryptophan Oxygenase",,,https://openalex.org/W2230856127,91,13,1,1948,320,11

false,the mechanism of hypotension following angiography,"the hypotension observed following the intracardiac injection of contrast media is believed to be the result of myocardial depression, peripheral vasodilatation, or both. it is unclear which of these factors is primarily involved in different types of angiography. to assess this problem, renografin-76 was injected into the aortic root of 15 anesthetized dogs (1 ml/kg) and into the left coronary artery (3-5 ml) in 18 dogs. the heart rate, the systolic and diastolic arterial pressures, left ventricular pressure, peak dp/dt and dp/dt-40 were monitored continuously until return to baseline. following selective left coronary artery injection, both systolic and diastolic pressures decreased maximally at 5 seconds with parallel changes in peak dp/dt and dp/dt-40. following the aortic root injection, the blood pressure response was biphasic, increasing at 5 seconds and decreasing maximally at 20 seconds. the corresponding changes in peak dp/dt and dp/dt-40 were initial depression at 5 seconds with quick return to baseline and increase above control at the time of maximal hypotension. the left ventricular end diastolic pressure rose maximally at 5 to 10 seconds for both coronary and aortic injections. the mechanism of hypotension, therefore, varies with the type of angiography. myocardial depression appears to be a primary factor with selective coronary angiography. however, with aortic root injection, myocardial contractility, although initially depressed, is already improved at the time of maximal hypotension, and thus peripheral vasocilatation is probably the prime mechanism of the hypotension.",Chahine RA,1976,Invest Radiol,https://doi.org/10.1097/00004424-197609000-00153,977264,Chahine RA; Raizner AE,article,D016428: Journal Article,D000790: Angiocardiography; D000818: Animals; D003287: Contrast Media; D003973: Diatrizoate; D003974: Diatrizoate Meglumine; D004285: Dogs; D007022: Hypotension,,,https://openalex.org/W1978223474,50,6,1,1615,267,11

false,nmda receptor-mediated activation of medullary pro-nociceptive neurons is required for secondary thermal hyperalgesia,"there is now direct evidence that a class of neurons in the rostral ventromedial medulla (rvm) exerts a net facilitatory influence on spinal nociception. the present experiments were designed to test whether activation of these neurons, referred to as “on-cells”, is required as part of a positive feedback loop leading to secondary hyperalgesia in acute inflammation produced by topical application of mustard oil. activity of a characterized rvm neuron and paw withdrawals to heat (plantar surface) were recorded in barbiturate-anesthetized rats. following three baseline trials, mustard oil was applied to the skin above the knee. cell activity and paw withdrawal latencies were monitored for an additional 45 min. application of mustard oil produced an increase in on-cell discharge that was associated with a substantial decrease in withdrawal latency of the ipsilateral paw. blocking on-cell activation using local infusion of the nmda-receptor antagonist ap5 into the rvm prevented hyperalgesia. secondary thermal hyperalgesia following mustard oil was also associated with a significant decrease in the firing of “off-cells”, a cell population thought to exert a net inhibitory influence on nociception. depression of off-cell firing was unaffected by ap5 microinjection. the firing of “neutral cells”, which have no documented role in nociceptive modulation, was unchanged following mustard oil and also unaffected by ap5 infusion in the rvm. brainstem descending controls are receiving increasing attention in efforts to understand hyperalgesia and persistent pain states. the present experiments demonstrate that a novel, nmda-mediated activation of on-cells is required for secondary thermal hyperalgesia in acute inflammation.",Xu M,2007,Pain,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.pain.2006.08.020,16997469,Xu M; Kim CJ; Neubert MJ; Heinricher MM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000200: Action Potentials; D000208: Acute Disease; D000818: Animals; D005073: Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; D006358: Hot Temperature; D006930: Hyperalgesia; D007249: Inflammation; D008297: Male; D008526: Medulla Oblongata; D009149: Mustard Plant; D009475: Neurons, Afferent; D009619: Nociceptors; D017288: Pain Threshold; D010938: Plant Oils; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",,,https://openalex.org/W1977286971,117,13,1,1739,279,12

true,chronic mild stress and antidepressant treatment alter 5-ht1a receptor expression by modifying dna methylation of a conserved sp4 site,"the serotonin 1a receptor (5-ht1a), a critical regulator of the brain serotonergic tone, is implicated in major depressive disorder (mdd) where it is often found to be dys-regulated. however, the extent to which stress and antidepressant treatment impact 5-ht1a expression in adults remains unclear. to address this issue, we subjected adult male balb/c mice to unpredictable chronic mild stress (ucms) to induce a depression-like phenotype that was reversed by chronic treatment with the antidepressant imipramine. in prefrontal cortex (pfc) and midbrain tissue, ucms increased 5-ht1a rna and protein levels, changes that are expected to decrease the brain serotonergic activity. the stress-induced increase in 5-ht1a expression was paralleled by a specific increase in dna methylation of the conserved -681 cpg promoter site, located within a sp1-like element. we show that the -681 cpg site is recognized and repressed by sp4, the predominant neuronal sp1-like factor and that sp4-induced repression is attenuated by dna methylation, despite a stress-induced increase in pfc sp4 levels. these results indicate that adult life stress induces dna methylation of a conserved promoter site, antagonizing sp4 repression to increase 5-ht1a expression. chronic imipramine treatment fully reversed the ucms-induced increase in methylation of the -681 cpg site in the pfc but not midbrain of stressed animals and also increased 5-ht1a expression in the pfc of control animals. incomplete reversal by imipramine of stress-induced changes in 5-ht1a methylation and expression indicates a persistence of stress vulnerability, and that sustained reversal of behavioral impairments may require additional pathways.",Le François B,2015,Neurobiol Dis,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.nbd.2015.07.002,26188176,Le François B; Soo J; Millar AM; Daigle M; Le Guisquet AM; Leman S; Minier F; Belzung C; Albert PR,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000929: Antidepressive Agents, Tricyclic; D002908: Chronic Disease; D017124: Conserved Sequence; D018899: CpG Islands; D019175: DNA Methylation; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D065847: Dorsal Raphe Nucleus; D007099: Imipramine; D008297: Male; D008807: Mice, Inbred BALB C; D017397: Prefrontal Cortex; D011401: Promoter Regions, Genetic; D012333: RNA, Messenger; D044282: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT1A; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D014158: Transcription, Genetic",,,https://openalex.org/W1602968777,134,19,1,1703,275,9

false,effects of dopamine and other catecholamines on the splanchnic circulation,"studies were conducted to evaluate the effects of dopamine (3, 4-dihydroxyphenylethylamine) and other catecholamines on the mesenteric vascular bed in dogs. mesenteric and hepatic artery blood flows were measured with electromagnetic blood flow transducers. catecholamines were infused intra-arterially into a branch-of the mesenteric artery. dopamine consistently decreased mesenteric and hepatic artery blood flows at all dose levels studied (5–100 mg/kg). phenoxybenzamine (12.5 mg/kg) blocked the effects of norepinephrine (0.05–1.0 μg/kg) and reversed the responses to dopamine in the mesenteric bed to those of pure vasodilation (no transient constriction was observed) but failed to abolish the constrictor action of dopamine on the hepatic artery. propranolol or haloperidol, when administered with the phenoxybenzamine, did not attenuate the mesenteric responses to dopamine. haloperidol prevented the hepatic artery vasoconstriction produced by dopamine but did not alter isoproterenol-induced hepatic artery vasodilation. no competitive action was observed between dopamine and norepinephrine or isoproterenol. these results suggest that (1) dopamine produces selective vasodilation of the mesenteric bed which is not blocked by haloperidol, and (2) dopamine has a unique action on the hepatic vascular bed which is blocked by haloperidol.",Shanbour LL,1972,Can J Physiol Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1139/y72-088,5047745,Shanbour LL; Parker D,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001783: Blood Flow Velocity; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002395: Catecholamines; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004285: Dogs; D004298: Dopamine; D018492: Dopamine Antagonists; D005260: Female; D006220: Haloperidol; D006499: Hepatic Artery; D007700: Kinetics; D008297: Male; D008638: Mesenteric Arteries; D009638: Norepinephrine; D010643: Phenoxybenzamine; D011433: Propranolol; D014662: Vasoconstrictor Agents; D014665: Vasodilator Agents; D014690: Venous Pressure",,,https://openalex.org/W2029768262,74,10,1,1350,210,9
true,repeated co-administrations of alcohol- and methamphetamine-produced anxiogenic effect could be associated with the neurotoxicity in the dentate gyrus,"to date, joint use of alcohol (etoh) and methamphetamine (ma) represents a specific combination of polydrug abuse. repeated administrations of etoh, ma, and combined etoh and ma were assessed for their effects on brain cell toxicity, cell mitosis and anxiety/depression-like behavior. we found that repeated co-administrations of etoh and ma produced profound anxiogenic effects. specifically, combined etoh and ma decreased open arm exploratory responses in the elevated plus maze test. moreover, combined etoh and ma significantly decreased immobile responses in the tail suspension test. ma, etoh, and their combination all reduced the number of neun-positive cells in amygdala (amg), while neither of them altered the number of neun-positive cells in striatum (st) or prefrontal cortex (pfc). combined etoh and ma decreased the number of neun-positive cells in dentate gyrus (dg). etoh, ma, and combined etoh and ma all diminished comparable number of gfap-positive cells in amg, dg, and st. neither of these treatment affected the number of gfap-positive cells in pfc. etoh, ma, and combined etoh and ma generated comparable inhibiting effects on cell proliferation in the subventricular zone (svz) and dg. these results, taken together, suggest that repeated co-administrations of ma and etoh may produce an observable anxiogenic effect. this combination-produced anxiogenic effect could be associated with neuronal loss in the dentate gurus. in contrast, such an anxiogenic effect is less likely related to this combination-caused glial toxicity in limbic regions or cell proliferation-inhibiting effect in the svz or dg.",Chuang JY,2011,J Neural Transm (Vienna),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00702-011-0645-2,21499940,Chuang JY; Chang WT; Cherng CG; Kao GS; Yu L,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D018759: Adrenergic Uptake Inhibitors; D020268: Alcohol-Induced Disorders, Nervous System; D000818: Animals; D001008: Anxiety Disorders; D002492: Central Nervous System Depressants; D018891: Dentate Gyrus; D004334: Drug Administration Schedule; D004338: Drug Combinations; D000431: Ethanol; D008297: Male; D008694: Methamphetamine; D051379: Mice; D008807: Mice, Inbred BALB C; D009410: Nerve Degeneration",,,https://openalex.org/W2050100742,150,18,1,1628,286,13
false,impairment of macrophage functions after ingestion of plasmodium falciparum-infected erythrocytes or isolated malarial pigment.,"human monocyte-derived macrophages ingest diamide-treated red blood cells (rbc), anti-d immunoglobulin (ig)g-opsonized rbc, or plasmodium falciparum ring-stage parasitized rbc (rprbc), degrade ingested hemoglobin rapidly, and can repeat the phagocytic cycle. monocytes fed with trophozoite-parasitized rbc (tprbc), which contain malarial pigment, or fed with isolated pigment are virtually unable to degrade the ingested material and to repeat the phagocytic cycle. monocytes fed with pigment display a long-lasting oxidative burst that does not occur when they phagocytose diamide-treated rbc or rprbc. the phorbol myristate acetate-elicited oxidative burst is irreversibly suppressed in monocytes fed with tprbc or pigment, but not in monocytes fed with diamide-treated or igg-opsonized rbc. this pattern of inhibition of phagocytosis and oxidative burst suggests that malarial pigment is responsible for the toxic effects. pigment iron released in the monocyte phagolysosome may be the responsible element. 3% of total pigment iron is labile and easily detached under conditions simulating the internal environment of the phagolysosome, i.e., ph 5.5 and 10 microm h2o2. iron liberated from pigment could account for the lipid peroxidation and increased production of malondialdehyde observed in monocytes fed with pigment or in rbc ghosts and liposomes incubated at ph 6.5 in presence of pigment and low amounts of h2o2. removal of the labile iron fraction from pigment by repeated treatments with 0.1 mm h2o2 at ph 5.5 reduces pigment toxicity. it is suggested that iron released from ingested pigment is responsible for the intoxication of monocytes. in acute and chronic falciparum infections, circulating and tissue-resident phagocytes are seen filled with tprbc and pigment particles over long periods of time. moreover, human monocytes previously fed with tprbc are unable to neutralize pathogenic bacteria, fungi, and tumor cells, and macrophage responses decline during the course of human and animal malaria. the present results may offer a mechanistic explanation for depression of cellular immunity in malaria.",Schwarzer E,1992,J Exp Med,https://doi.org/10.1084/jem.176.4.1033,1402649,Schwarzer E; Turrini F; Ulliers D; Giribaldi G; Ginsburg H; Arese P,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000255: Adenosine Triphosphate; D000818: Animals; D002469: Cell Separation; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D004910: Erythrocyte Membrane; D004912: Erythrocytes; D006418: Heme; D006801: Humans; D007501: Iron; D007700: Kinetics; D008054: Lipid Peroxides; D008264: Macrophages; D009000: Monocytes; D010587: Phagocytosis; D010860: Pigments, Biological; D010963: Plasmodium falciparum; D013755: Tetradecanoylphorbol Acetate; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W1898868640,127,15,1,2124,343,13

false,establishing a probabilistic reversal learning test in mice: evidence for the processes mediating reward-stay and punishment-shift behaviour and for their modulation by serotonin,"valid animal models of psychopathology need to include behavioural readouts informed by human findings. in the probabilistic reversal learning (prl) task, human subjects are confronted with serial reversal of the contingency between two operant stimuli and reward/punishment and, superimposed on this, a low probability (0.2) of punished correct responses/rewarded incorrect responses. in depression, reward-stay and reversals completed are unaffected but response-shift following punished correct response trials, referred to as negative feedback sensitivity (nfs), is increased. the aims of this study were to: establish an operant spatial prl test appropriate for mice; obtain evidence for the processes mediating reward-stay and punishment-shift responding; and assess effects thereon of genetically- and pharmacologically-altered serotonin (5-ht) function. the study was conducted with wildtype (wt) and heterozygous mutant (het) mice from a 5-ht transporter (5-htt) null mutant strain. mice were mildly food deprived and reward was sugar pellet and punishment was 5-s time out. mice exhibited high motivation and adaptive reversal performance. increased probability of punished correct response (pcr) trials per session (p = 0.1, 0.2 or 0.3) led to monotonic decrease in reward-stay and reversals completed, suggesting accurate reward prediction. nfs differed from chance-level at p pcr = 0.1, suggesting accurate punishment prediction, whereas nfs was at chance-level at p = 0.2-0.3. at p pcr = 0.1, het mice exhibited lower nfs than wt mice. the 5-htt blocker escitalopram was studied acutely at p pcr = 0.2: a low dose (0.5-1.5 mg/kg) resulted in decreased nfs, increased reward-stay and increased reversals completed, and similarly in wt and het mice. this study demonstrates that testing prl in mice can provide evidence on the regulation of reward and punishment processing that is, albeit within certain limits, of relevance to human emotional-cognitive processing, its dysfunction and treatment.",Ineichen C,2012,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2012.07.025,22824190,Ineichen C; Sigrist H; Spinelli S; Lesch KP; Sautter E; Seifritz E; Pryce CR,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D018687: Antidepressive Agents, Second-Generation; D015283: Citalopram; D003216: Conditioning, Operant; D003863: Depression; D005260: Female; D008027: Light; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D015233: Models, Statistical; D011597: Psychomotor Performance; D011678: Punishment; D012055: Reinforcement Schedule; D012193: Reversal Learning; D012201: Reward; D012701: Serotonin; D050486: Serotonin Plasma Membrane Transport Proteins; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",,,https://openalex.org/W2094383050,178,24,1,2009,341,12

false,quantitative analysis of calcium-dependent vesicle recruitment and its functional role at the calyx of held synapse,"recruitment of release-ready vesicles at synapses is one of the important factors, which determine dynamic properties of signaling between neurons in the brain. it has been shown that the rate of vesicle recruitment is accelerated by strong synaptic activity. an elevated concentration of calcium ions in the presynaptic terminal ([ca2+]i) has been proposed to be responsible for this effect. however, the precise relationship between [ca2+]i and recruitment has not been established yet, and the functional consequences of accelerated recruitment during synaptic activity have not been quantified experimentally. to probe the intracellular ca2+ dependence of vesicle recruitment and to examine its functional role during trains of action potential (ap)-like stimuli, we monitored [ca2+]i and synaptic responses simultaneously with paired recordings at the calyx of held synapse. we found that a distinct, rapidly releasing vesicle pool is replenished with a rate that increases linearly with [ca2+]i, without any apparent cooperativity. the slope factor for this increase is approximately 1 pool/(microm x s). blocking ca2+-dependent recruitment specifically with a calmodulin binding peptide revealed that the steady-state epscs during 100 hz ap-like trains were maintained through this ca2+-dependent recruitment mechanism. using a simple model of vesicle dynamics, we estimated that the recruitment rate accelerated 10-fold during the steady-state compared with the rate at resting [ca2+]i. we could also demonstrate an approximate sixfold increase in release probability (facilitation) during the initial 5-15 ap-like stimuli of such trains in our experimental condition, regardless of epsc depression.",Hosoi N,2007,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.4122-07.2007,18160636,Hosoi N; Sakaba T; Neher E,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000200: Action Potentials; D000818: Animals; D000831: Animals, Newborn; D001933: Brain Stem; D002118: Calcium; D003198: Computer Simulation; D004307: Dose-Response Relationship, Radiation; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008954: Models, Biological; D010455: Peptides; D017729: Presynaptic Terminals; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013572: Synaptic Vesicles; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2000436563,115,16,1,1707,283,10
false,inhibition by indomethacin of ovulation induced by human chorionic gonadotrophin in immature rats primed with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin,"treatment of immature rats with pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin followed by human chorionic gonadotrophin (hcg) caused an acute and temporary increase in concentrations of progesterone, testosterone and oestradiol in plasma with maximum levels 3 h after the administration of hcg. concurrent injection of indomethacin and hcg reduced, in a dose-dependent manner, the mean number of ova shed and this was accompanied by a dose-dependent decrease in concentrations of plasma progesterone and testosterone but not of oestradiol when they were measured 3 h after the injection of hcg. the minimum effective dose that blocked ovulation completely at 0 h abolished the acute increase of progesterone and testosterone, suggesting that prostaglandins act on ovulation by stimulating steroidogenesis at an early stage in the preovulatory process. the anti-ovulatory action of the minimum effective dose at 0 h became progressively less potent as the time between injection of hcg and administration of indomethacin was increased, although plasma concentrations of progesterone and testosterone measured at autopsy 18 h after treatment with hcg had not changed appreciably. when indomethacin was administered 10 h after hcg, the relationship between the dose of indomethacin and the mean number of ova differed from that observed when simultaneous injections of indomethacin and hcg were given, and the minimum effective dose that prevented ovulation was much higher than that at 0 h, suggesting that prostaglandins act differently on ovulation in the later stage of the preovulatory process. it was concluded that prostaglandins may mediate the action of hcg on ovulation through two mechanisms which operate at different stages of the preovulatory process.",Mori T,1980,J Endocrinol,https://doi.org/10.1677/joe.0.0840333,7391712,Mori T; Kohda H; Kinoshita Y; Ezaki Y; Morimoto N; Nishimura T,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D006063: Chorionic Gonadotropin; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004958: Estradiol; D005260: Female; D006064: Gonadotropins, Equine; D007016: Hypophysectomy; D007213: Indomethacin; D010060: Ovulation; D010062: Ovulation Induction; D011374: Progesterone; D051381: Rats; D012741: Sexual Maturation; D013739: Testosterone; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2080474310,143,19,1,1750,277,6

true,microglia activation is associated with ifn-α induced depressive-like behavior,"inflammatory immune activation has been frequently associated with the development of major depression. this association was confirmed in patients receiving long-term treatment with pro-inflammatory interferon-α (ifn-α). microglia, the resident immune cells in the brain, might serve as an important interface in this immune system-to-brain communication. the aim of the present study was to investigate the role of microglia in an ifn-α mouse model of immune-mediated depression. male balb/c mice were treated with daily injections of ifn-α for two weeks. depressive-like behavior was analyzed in the forced swim and tail suspension test. activation of microglia was measured by flow cytometry. pro-inflammatory m1 type (mhc-ii, cd40, cd54, cd80, cd86, ccr7), anti-inflammatory m2 type (cd206, cd200r), and maturation markers (cd11c, ccr7) were tested, as well as the chemokine receptor ccr2. ifn-α led to a significant increase in depressive-like behavior and expression of the pro-inflammatory surface markers mhc-ii, cd86, and cd54, indicating m1 polarization. because ifn-α-treated mice showed great individual variance in the behavioral response to ifn-α, they were further divided into vulnerable and non-vulnerable subgroups. only ifn-α vulnerable mice (characterized by their development of depressive-like behavior in response to ifn-α) showed an increased expression of mhc-ii and cd86, while cd54 was similarly enhanced in both subgroups. thus, ifn-α-induced activation of microglia was specifically associated with depressive-like behavior.",Wachholz S,2016,Brain Behav Immun,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2015.09.016,26408795,Wachholz S; Eßlinger M; Plümper J; Manitz MP; Juckel G; Friebe A,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D003863: Depression; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D007155: Immunologic Factors; D016898: Interferon-alpha; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008807: Mice, Inbred BALB C; D017628: Microglia",,,https://openalex.org/W2155173051,78,9,1,1553,254,12
false,heterosynaptic facilitation of tail sensory neuron synaptic transmission during habituation in tail-induced tail and siphon withdrawal reflexes of aplysia.,"in cellular studies of habituation, such as in the gill and siphon withdrawal reflex to tactile stimulation of the siphon of aplysia, a mechanism that has emerged as an explanation for response decrement during habituation is homosynaptic depression at sensory neurons mediating the behavioral response. we have examined the contribution of homosynaptic depression to habituation in sensory neurons that contribute to two reflex behaviors in aplysia, tail withdrawal and siphon withdrawal, both elicited by threshold-level tail stimulation. in a companion paper (this issue), we reported that repeated tail stimulation, identical to that producing habituation in siphon withdrawal in freely moving animals, also produces habituation in reduced preparations. in this paper, we extend these behavioral findings by showing that in reduced preparations, identical tail stimulation also produces habituation of the tail withdrawal reflex. in addition, our cellular experiments show that (1) identified sensory and motor neurons in both reflex systems respond to identical repeated tail stimulation; in sensory neurons it produces a progressive decrease in spike number and increase in spike latency, and in motor neurons it produces progressive decrement in complex epsps and spike output. (2) homosynaptic depression of the tail sensory neuron to tail motor neuron synapse does occur when the sensory neurons are activated repetitively by intracellular current. (3) homosynaptic depression at this synapse does not occur when the sensory neurons are activated repetitively by threshold-level tail stimuli that elicit the behavioral reflex and cause habituation; rather, the sensory neurons exhibit significant heterosynaptic facilitation. thus, in these reflexes, habituation is not accompanied by homosynaptic depression at the sensory neurons, suggesting that the plasticity underlying habituation occurs primarily at interneuronal sites.",Stopfer M,1996,J Neurosci,10.1523/jneurosci.16-16-04933.1996,8756425,Stopfer M; Carew TJ,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001048: Aplysia; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D006185: Habituation, Psychophysiologic; D009046: Motor Neurons; D009475: Neurons, Afferent; D012018: Reflex; D013569: Synapses; D009435: Synaptic Transmission; D013623: Tail",,,https://openalex.org/W1825369211,155,20,1,1936,305,8

true,sustained running in rats administered corticosterone prevents the development of depressive behaviors and enhances hippocampal neurogenesis and synaptic plasticity without increasing neurotrophic factor levels,"we have previously shown that voluntary running acts as an anxiolytic and ameliorates deficits in hippocampal neurogenesis and spatial learning. it also reduces depression-like behaviors that are normally observed in rats that were administered either low (30 mg/kg) or moderate (40 mg/kg) doses of corticosterone (cort). however, the protective effects of running were absent in rats treated with a high (50 mg/kg) dose of cort. we examined whether allowing animals to exercise for 2 weeks prior and/or concurrently with the administration of 50 mg/kg cort treatment could have similar protective effects. we examined hippocampal neurogenesis using immunohistochemical staining of proliferative and survival cells with the thymidine analogs (brdu, cidu, and idu). in addition, we monitored synaptic protein expression and quantified the levels of neurotrophic factors in these animals as well as performing behavioral analyses (forced swim test and sucrose preference test). our results indicate that the depressive phenotype and reductions in neurogenesis that normally accompany high cort administration could only be prevented by allowing animals to exercise both prior to and concurrently with the cort administration period. these animals also showed increases in both synaptophysin and psd-95 protein levels, but surprisingly, neither brain-derived neurotrophic factor (bdnf) nor insulin-like growth factor 1 (igf-1) levels were increased in these animals. the results suggest that persistent exercise can strengthen resilience to stress by promoting hippocampal neurogenesis and increasing synaptic protein levels, thereby reducing the deleterious effects of stress.",Yau SY,2014,Cell Transplant,https://doi.org/10.3727/096368914x678490,24816445,Yau SY; Li A; Zhang ED; Christie BR; Xu A; Lee TM; So KF,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000893: Anti-Inflammatory Agents; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D019208: Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor; D003345: Corticosterone; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D000076122: Disks Large Homolog 4 Protein; D006624: Hippocampus; D007334: Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; D047908: Intracellular Signaling Peptides and Proteins; D008297: Male; D008565: Membrane Proteins; D009414: Nerve Growth Factors; D055495: Neurogenesis; D009473: Neuronal Plasticity; D010641: Phenotype; D010805: Physical Conditioning, Animal; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013569: Synapses; D016708: Synaptophysin",,,https://openalex.org/W1984977814,210,24,1,1674,267,9

false,pentobarbitone modulation of nmda receptors in neurones isolated from the rat olfactory brain,1. the action of pentobarbitone on the n-methyl-d-aspartate (nmda) receptors of neurones freshly dissociated from the olfactory bulb and olfactory tubercle has been studied using patch-clamp techniques. 2. pentobarbitone produced a concentration-dependent depression of the currents evoked by nmda with an ic50 value of c. 250 microm. 3. analysis of the nmda-evoked noise produced power spectra that could be fitted by the sum of two lorentzians with corner frequencies of 17 and 82 hz. pentobarbitone increased the corner frequency of the high frequency component but did not alter the apparent single channel conductance estimated from the noise. 4. single channel recordings in either the cell-attached or outside-out patch configurations revealed that nmda (20 or 50 microm) opened channels with a main conductance level around 55 ps and a principal subconductance around 44 ps. the uncorrected mean open time of the channels was 3.4 ms and mean burst length was 6.0 ms. mean cluster length was about 12 ms. 5. pentobarbitone produced a concentration-dependent reduction in both mean open time and burst length. mean cluster length was much less affected. pentobarbitone did not decrease unitary current amplitude or bias the open-state current amplitude distribution in favour of a particular substate. 6. from these data it appears that pentobarbitone depresses the inward current evoked by nmda by reducing the probability of channel opening and this results from a shortening of the lifetime of the channel open state and by decreasing burst length.,Charlesworth P,1995,Br J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1476-5381.1995.tb15956.x,8680736,Charlesworth P; Jacobson I; Richards CD,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007700: Kinetics; D009474: Neurons; D009830: Olfactory Bulb; D009833: Olfactory Pathways; D018408: Patch-Clamp Techniques; D010634: Phenobarbital; D051381: Rats; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate",,,https://openalex.org/W1969650371,93,13,1,1557,260,16
false,effect of lutropin and cycloheximide on lutropin receptors and cyclic amp production in leydig tumour cells in vitro,"a system to study lutropin-induced desensitization of tumour leydig cells in vitro has been investigated. tumour leydig cells were purified on a percoll gradient and then incubated for 30 min with lutropin (0-1000ng/ml). the cells were then washed and incubated in suspension media at 32 degrees c. 125i-labelled human choriogonadotropin binding and basal and lutropin-stimulated cyclic amp production were determined at various times. initially the cells showed a dose-dependent decrease in human choriogonadotropin binding (1.18 and 0.13fmol/10(6) cells respectively) followed by an increase at 1 h (2.32 and 0.87fmol/10(6) cells respectively). human choriogonadotropin binding remained elevated in the cells pre-incubated without lutropin, whereas the cells pre-incubated with lutropin showed a dose-dependent decrease over the next 10 h (2.20-0.18fmol/10(6) cells respectively). basal production of cyclic amp initially reflected the pre-incubation conditions (1.17-21.19ng/10(6) cells per h for 0-1000ng of lutropin/ml respectively). however, by 1 h there was a marked rise in basal cyclic amp production which returned to the initial lower values by 4 h. at all time intervals studied, lutropin-induced cyclic amp production showed a decrease that was proportional to lutropin concentration in the pre-incubated media. the decreases in human choriogonadotropin binding produced by pre-incubations with lutropin (100ng/ml) was partially inhibited by the presence of cycloheximide in the pre-incubation media and totally prevented by the continuous presence of cycloheximide. these results demonstrate that desensitization of tumour leydig cells occurs after exposure to lutropin in vitro. this desensitization involves both a loss of plasma membrane receptors for lutropin and lutropin-stimulated adenylate cyclase. these events can be prevented by cycloheximide and are therefore probably dependent on protein synthesis.",Dix CJ,1981,Biochem J,https://doi.org/10.1042/bj1960713,6274319,Dix CJ; Cooke BA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000242: Cyclic AMP; D003513: Cycloheximide; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D007984: Leydig Cell Tumor; D007986: Luteinizing Hormone; D008297: Male; D051381: Rats; D011956: Receptors, Cell Surface; D011974: Receptors, LH",,,https://openalex.org/W156158221,123,24,1,1926,303,11
false,overexpression of synapsin ia in the rat calyx of held accelerates short-term plasticity and decreases synaptic vesicle volume and active zone area,"synapsins are synaptic vesicle (sv) proteins organizing a component of the reserve pool of vesicles at most central nervous system synapses. alternative splicing of the three mammalian genes results in multiple isoforms that may differentially contribute to the organization and maintenance of the synaptic vesicle-pools. to address this, we first characterized the expression pattern of synapsin isoforms in the rat calyx of held. at postnatal day 16, synapsins ia, ib, iib and iiia were present, while iia – known to sustain repetitive transmission in glutamatergic terminals – was not detectable. to test if the synapsin i isoforms could mediate iia-like effect, and if this depends on the presence of the e-domain, we overexpressed either synapsin ia or synapsin ib in the rat calyx of held via recombinant adeno-associated virus-mediated gene transfer. although the size and overall structure of the perturbed calyces remained unchanged, short-term depression and recovery from depression were accelerated upon overexpression of synapsin i isoforms. thus, at the calyx of held, synapsin ia may not substitute for the synapsin iia-function reported for hippocampal synapses. using electron microscopic three-dimensional reconstructions we found a redistribution of sv clusters proximal to the active zones (az) alongside with a decrease of both az area and sv volume. the number of svs at individual azs was strongly reduced. hence, our data indicate that the amount of synapsin ia expressed in the calyx regulates the rate and extent of short-term synaptic plasticity by affecting vesicle recruitment to the az. finally, our study reveals a novel contribution of synapsin ia to define the surface area of azs.",Vasileva M,2013,Front Cell Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2013.00270,24391547,Vasileva M; Renden R; Horstmann H; Gitler D; Kuner T,article,D016428: Journal Article,,,,https://openalex.org/W1980708565,147,22,1,1714,289,11

false,synaptic scaling mediated by glial tnf-α,"two general forms of synaptic plasticity that operate on different timescales are thought to contribute to the activity-dependent refinement of neural circuitry during development: (1) long-term potentiation (ltp) and long-term depression (ltd), which involve rapid adjustments in the strengths of individual synapses in response to specific patterns of correlated synaptic activity, and (2) homeostatic synaptic scaling, which entails uniform adjustments in the strength of all synapses on a cell in response to prolonged changes in the cell's electrical activity. without homeostatic synaptic scaling, neural networks can become unstable and perform suboptimally. although much is known about the mechanisms underlying ltp and ltd, little is known about the mechanisms responsible for synaptic scaling except that such scaling is due, at least in part, to alterations in receptor content at synapses. here we show that synaptic scaling in response to prolonged blockade of activity is mediated by the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumour-necrosis factor-alpha (tnf-alpha). using mixtures of wild-type and tnf-alpha-deficient neurons and glia, we also show that glia are the source of the tnf-alpha that is required for this form of synaptic scaling. we suggest that by modulating tnf-alpha levels, glia actively participate in the homeostatic activity-dependent regulation of synaptic connectivity.",Stellwagen D,2006,Nature,https://doi.org/10.1038/nature04671,16547515,Stellwagen D; Malenka RC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000818: Animals; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D006624: Hippocampus; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D036881: Long-Term Synaptic Depression; D051379: Mice; D009415: Nerve Net; D009457: Neuroglia; D009474: Neurons; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D018091: Receptors, AMPA; D018124: Receptors, Tumor Necrosis Factor; D015398: Signal Transduction; D013569: Synapses; D013779: Tetrodotoxin; D014409: Tumor Necrosis Factor-alpha",,,https://openalex.org/W1542136448,40,6,1,1396,225,6

false,thyroid hormones regulate anxiety in the male mouse,"thyroid hormone levels are implicated in mood disorders in the adult human but the mechanisms remain unclear partly because, in rodent models, more attention has been paid to the consequences of perinatal hypo and hyperthyroidism. thyroid hormones act via the thyroid hormone receptor (tr) α and β isoforms, both of which are expressed in the limbic system. tr's modulate gene expression via both unliganded and liganded actions. though the thyroid hormone receptor (tr) knockouts and a transgenic trα1 knock-in mouse have provided us valuable insight into behavioral phenotypes such as anxiety and depression, it is not clear if this is because of the loss of unliganded actions or liganded actions of the receptor or due to locomotor deficits. we used a hypothyroid mouse model and supplementation with tri-iodothyronine (t3) or thyroxine (t4) to investigate the consequences of dysthyroid hormone levels on behaviors that denote anxiety. our data from the open field and the light–dark transition tests suggest that adult onset hypothyroidism in male mice produces a mild anxiogenic effect that is possibly due to unliganded receptor actions. t3 or t4 supplementation reverses this phenotype and euthyroid animals show anxiety that is intermediate between the hypothyroid and thyroid hormone supplemented groups. in addition, t3 but not t4 supplemented animals have lower spine density in the ca1 region of the hippocampus and in the central amygdala suggesting that t3-mediated rescue of the hypothyroid state might be due to lower neuronal excitability in the limbic circuit.",Buras A,2014,Horm Behav,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.yhbeh.2013.11.008,24333846,Buras A; Battle L; Landers E; Nguyen T; Vasudevan N,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001007: Anxiety; D003214: Conditioning, Classical; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D005239: Fear; D007037: Hypothyroidism; D008297: Male; D008713: Methimazole; D051379: Mice; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D013974: Thyroxine; D014284: Triiodothyronine",,,https://openalex.org/W2087520612,51,8,1,1580,265,8

false,fatty acid amide hydrolase inhibitors display broad selectivity and inhibit multiple carboxylesterases as off-targets,"fatty acid amide hydrolase (faah) is the primary regulator of several bioactive lipid amides including anandamide. inhibitors of faah are potentially useful for the treatment of pain, anxiety, depression, and other nervous system disorders. however, faah inhibitors must display selectivity for this enzyme relative to the numerous other serine hydrolases present in the human proteome in order to be therapeutically acceptable. here we employed activity-based protein profiling (abpp) to assess the selectivity of faah inhibitors in multiple rat and human tissues. we discovered that some inhibitors, including carbamate compounds sa-47 and sa-72, and am404 are exceptionally selective while others, like urb597, bms-1, ol-135, and ly2077855 are less selective, displaying multiple off-targets. since proteins around 60 kda constitute the major off-targets for urb597 and several other faah inhibitors with different chemical structures, we employed the multi-dimensional protein identification technology (mudpit) approach to analyze their identities. we identified multiple carboxylesterase isozymes as bona fide off-targets of faah inhibitors. consistently, enzymatic assay confirmed inhibition of carboxylesterase activities in rat liver by faah inhibitors. since carboxylesterases hydrolyze a variety of ester-containing drugs and prodrugs, we speculate that certain faah inhibitors, by inhibiting carboxylesterases, might have drug–drug interactions with other medicines if developed as therapeutic agents.",Zhang D,2007,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropharm.2006.11.009,17217969,Zhang D; Saraf A; Kolasa T; Bhatia P; Zheng GZ; Patel M; Lannoye GS; Richardson P; Stewart A; Rogers JC; Brioni JD; Surowy CS,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000581: Amidohydrolases; D000818: Animals; D000906: Antibodies; D001549: Benzamides; D001921: Brain; D002219: Carbamates; D043182: Carboxylesterase; D045744: Cell Line, Tumor; D004789: Enzyme Activation; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D006321: Heart; D006801: Humans; D007668: Kidney; D008099: Liver; D020543: Proteome; D051381: Rats; D014162: Transfection",,,https://openalex.org/W2034299493,117,14,1,1513,232,9

true,early life stress alters adult serotonin 2c receptor pre-mrna editing and expression of the α subunit of the heterotrimeric g-protein gq,"infant maternal separation, a paradigm of early life stress in rodents, elicits long-lasting changes in gene expression that persist into adulthood. in balb/c mice, an inbred strain with spontaneously elevated anxiety and stress reactivity, infant maternal separation led to increased depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress and robustly increased editing of serotonin 2c receptor pre-mrna. chronic fluoxetine treatment of adult balb/c mice exposed to early life stress affected neither their behavioral responses to stress nor their basal 5-ht2c pre-mrna editing phenotype. however, when fluoxetine was administered during adolescence, depression-like behavioral responses to stress were significantly diminished in these mice, and their basal and stress-induced 5-ht2c pre-mrna editing phenotypes were significantly lower. moreover, when balb/c mice exposed to early life stress were raised in an enriched postweaning environment, their depression-like behavioral responses to adult stress were also significantly diminished. however, their 5-ht2c pre-mrna editing phenotype remained unaltered. hence, the similar behavioral effects of enrichment and fluoxetine treatment during adolescence were not accompanied by similar changes in 5-ht2c pre-mrna editing. enriched and nonenriched balb/c mice exposed to early life stress also exhibited significantly increased expression of mrna and protein encoding the g alpha q subunit of g-protein that couples to 5-ht2a/2c receptors. in contrast, g alpha q expression levels were significantly lower in fluoxetine-treated mice. these findings suggest that compensatory changes in g alpha q expression occur in mice with persistently altered 5-ht2c pre-mrna editing and provide an explanation for the dissociation between 5-ht2c receptor editing phenotypes and behavioral stress responses.",Bhansali P,2007,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.4632-06.2007,17287521,Bhansali P; Dunning J; Singer SE; David L; Schmauss C,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural","D000367: Age Factors; D000818: Animals; D001010: Anxiety, Separation; D001835: Body Weight; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004644: Emotions; D004777: Environment; D005260: Female; D005473: Fluoxetine; D043802: GTP-Binding Protein alpha Subunits, Gq-G11; D020022: Genetic Predisposition to Disease; D006380: Helplessness, Learned; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008807: Mice, Inbred BALB C; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D019579: Neocortex; D020033: Protein Isoforms; D017393: RNA Editing; D012322: RNA Precursors; D011897: Random Allocation; D044405: Receptor, Serotonin, 5-HT2C; D012701: Serotonin; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; D013045: Species Specificity; D013550: Swimming",,,https://openalex.org/W2011635150,136,21,1,1845,271,10

false,enaminones and norepinephrine employ convergent mechanisms to depress excitatory synaptic transmission in the rat nucleus accumbens in vitro,"abstract we recently reported that anticonvulsant anilino enaminones depress excitatory postsynaptic currents (epscs) in the nucleus accumbens (nac) indirectly via γ‐aminobutyric acid (gaba) acting on gaba b receptors [ s.b. kombian et al . (2005) br. j. pharmacol ., 145, 945–953]. norepinephrine (ne) and dopamine (da), both known to be involved in seizure disorders, also depress epscs in this nucleus. the current study explored a possible interaction between enaminones and adrenergic and/or dopaminergic mechanisms that may contribute to their synaptic depression and anticonvulsant effect. using whole‐cell recording in rat forebrain slices containing the nac, we show that ne‐induced, but not da‐induced, epsc depression occludes e139‐induced epsc depressant effect. uk14,304, a selective α 2 receptor agonist, mimicked the synaptic effect of ne and also occluded e139 effects. phentolamine, a non‐selective α‐adrenergic antagonist that blocked ne‐induced epsc depression, also blocked the e139‐induced epsc depression. furthermore, yohimbine, an α 2 ‐adrenoceptor antagonist, also blocked the e139‐induced epsc depression, while prazosin, a selective α 1 ‐adrenergic antagonist, and propranolol, a non‐selective β‐adrenoceptor antagonist, did not block the e139 effect. similar to the e139‐induced epsc depression, the ne‐induced epsc depression was also blocked by the gaba b receptor antagonist, cgp55845. by contrast, however, neither sch23390 nor sulpiride, d1‐like and d2‐like da receptor antagonists, respectively, blocked the e139‐induced synaptic depression. these results suggest that ne and e139, but not da, employ a similar mechanism to depress epscs in the nac, and support the hypothesis that e139, like ne, may act on α 2 ‐adrenoceptors to cause the release of gaba, which then mediates synaptic depression via gaba b receptors.",Kombian SB,2006,Eur J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1460-9568.2006.05152.x,17156204,Kombian SB; Ananthalakshmi KV; Edafiogho IO,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000316: Adrenergic alpha-Agonists; D000317: Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; D000818: Animals; D000068438: Brimonidine Tartrate; D003510: Cyclohexanes; D004298: Dopamine; D004347: Drug Interactions; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018756: GABA Antagonists; D066298: In Vitro Techniques; D008297: Male; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009638: Norepinephrine; D009714: Nucleus Accumbens; D010721: Phosphinic Acids; D011224: Prazosin; D011412: Propanolamines; D011810: Quinoxalines; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2016213211,147,24,1,1852,320,13

false,oxygen and glucose deprivation (ogd)-induced spreading depression in the substantia nigra,"spreading depression (sd) is a profound depolarization of neurons and glia that propagates in a wave-like manner across susceptible brain regions, and can develop during periods of compromised cellular energy such as ischemia, when it influences the severity of acute neuronal damage. although sd has been well characterized in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus, little is known of this event in the substantia nigra (sn), a brainstem nucleus engaged in motor control and reward-related behavior. transverse brain slices (250 μm; p21–23 rats) containing the sn were subject to oxygen and glucose deprivation (ogd) tests, modeling brain ischemia. sd developed in lateral aspects of the sn within 3.3±0.2 min of ogd onset, and spread through the substantia nigra pars reticulata (snr), as indicated by fast-occurring and propagating increased tissue light transmittance and negative shift of extracellular dc potential. these events were associated with profound mitochondrial membrane depolarization (δψm) throughout the sn, as demonstrated by increased rhodamine 123 fluorescence. extracellular recordings from individual snr neurons indicated rapid depolarization followed by depolarizing block, while dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra pars compacta (snc) showed inhibition of firing associated with hyperpolarization. sd evoked in the snr was similar to ogd-induced sd in the ca1 region in hippocampal slices. in the hippocampus, sd also developed during anoxia or aglycemia alone (associated with less profound δψm than ogd), while these conditions rarely led to sd in the snr. our results demonstrate that ogd consistently evokes sd in the sn, and that this phenomenon only involves the snr. it remains to be established whether nigral sd contributes to neuronal damage associated with a sudden-onset form of parkinson's disease known as ‘vascular parkinsonism’.",Karunasinghe RN,2013,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2013.06.016,23796781,Karunasinghe RN; Lipski J,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D015687: Cell Hypoxia; D013181: Cortical Spreading Depression; D004594: Electrophysiology; D005947: Glucose; D002534: Hypoxia, Brain; D008839: Microelectrodes; D009924: Organ Culture Techniques; D010100: Oxygen; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013378: Substantia Nigra",,,https://openalex.org/W1966515235,89,14,1,1879,317,10
false,α‐amanitin and 5‐fluorouridine inhibition of serumstimulated dna synthesis in quiescent akr‐2b mouse embryo cells,"abstract akr‐2b mouse embryo cells undergoing the serum‐stimulated transition from a quiescent to a proliferating state exhibit an increase in the rate of hnrna synthesis which appears to be mediated through an increase in the actual number of rna polymerase ii molecules. α‐amanitin, administered early in the prereplication interval following stimulation, effectively inhibits hnrna synthesis, polysomal mrna accumulation, polyribosome formation, and subsequent dna synthesis, and cell division. unexpectedly, α‐amanitin treatment also produces almost complete inhibition of the synthesis of 45srrna precursor and the increase in accumulation of cytoplasmic rrna following serum stimulation. in order to determine whether the inhibition of new ribosomal synthesis might in itself be sufficient to prevent serum‐stimulated dna synthesis, the effects of 5‐fluorouridine (5‐fu), a specific inhibitor of 45srrna processing, were investigated. if added within eight hours following serum stimulation, 5‐fu was found to completely inhibit subsequent dna synthesis. these results suggest that quescent akr‐2b cells do not contain a sufficient excess of ribosomes to support the synthesis of proteins which are required for dna synthesis in response to serum growth factors. furthermore, an early polymerase ii mediated synthesis of mrna (s) coding for some factor(s) necessary for ribosomal gene transcription may be an essential step in the serum‐stimulated synthesis of new ribosomes.",Wells DJ,1979,J Cell Physiol,https://doi.org/10.1002/jcp.1041000202,159908,Wells DJ; Stoddard LS; Getz MJ; Moses HL,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000546: Amanitins; D000818: Animals; D002455: Cell Division; D002460: Cell Line; D004247: DNA; D012321: DNA-Directed RNA Polymerases; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004622: Embryo, Mammalian; D005467: Floxuridine; D051379: Mice; D008806: Mice, Inbred AKR; D012313: RNA; D012270: Ribosomes",,,https://openalex.org/W2115044840,113,14,1,1481,233,7

false,regulation of excitability and plasticity by endocannabinoids and pka in developing hippocampus,"the activity-dependent strengthening and weakening of synaptic transmission are hypothesized to be the basis of not only memory and learning but also the refinement of neural circuits during development. here we report that, in the developing ca1 area of the hippocampus, endocannabinoid (ecb)-mediated heterosynaptic long-term depression (ltd) of glutamatergic excitatory synaptic transmission is associated with pka-mediated homosynaptic long-term potentiation (ltp). this form of ltd was dominant at postnatal days 2-10 (p2-p10), attenuated during development, and finally disappeared in the mature hippocampus. heterosynaptic ltd of excitatory postsynaptic currents in the developing hippocampus was expressed presynaptically, spread to neighboring neurons, and was mediated by ecbs. heterosynaptic ltd of field excitatory postsynaptic potentials was associated with a decrease in fiber volley amplitude with a similar time course. depression of fiber volleys was blocked by k(+) channel blockers, suggesting the involvement of the decrease in presynaptic excitability in heterosynaptic ltd. in the p2-p5 hippocampus, ecbs also attenuate ltp and fiber volleys in homosynaptic pathways and help to prevent too much excitability in the neonatal hippocampus where the gabaergic system is poorly developed and even excitatory. in the hippocampus older than p6 (p > 6), however, ltp is protected from ecb-mediated depression by pka activated at presynaptic sites by high-frequency stimulation, serving to highlight pka-mediated ltp by weakening inactive synapses even in adjacent cells. thus, ecbs and pka make synapses plastic without changing excitability homeostasis in the developing hippocampus.",Yasuda H,2008,Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A,https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.0708349105,18287074,Yasuda H; Huang Y; Tsumoto T,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000367: Age Factors; D000704: Analysis of Variance; D000818: Animals; D063385: Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators; D017868: Cyclic AMP-Dependent Protein Kinases; D004594: Electrophysiology; D063388: Endocannabinoids; D006624: Hippocampus; D017774: Long-Term Potentiation; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W1983859218,95,12,1,1699,269,9
false,impact of a unilateral brain lesion on cortisol secretion and emotional state: anterior/posterior dissociation in humans,"the main goal of this study was to evaluate whether a unilateral brain lesion in a human population is associated with a modification of the circadian cortisol secretion profile, and/or patient's emotional state. the second goal of this study was to assess whether there would be differences in both the pattern of cortisol secretion and emotional state in brain-damaged patients as a function of side of lesion, and localization (anterior vs posterior) of lesion. eight patients with a left cortical lesion, six patients with a right cortical lesion, four patients with basal ganglia lesions (2 left and 2 right) and ten healthy volunteers were evaluated daily on measures of salivary cortisol levels and subjective feelings of joy and sadness at 0700, 1200, 1600 and 1900 hours over a 15-day period. patients with cortical brain lesions presented higher cortisol levels and higher scores of sadness at the time of the morning peak (7:00 am), when compared to healthy volunteers and patients with basal ganglia lesions. laterality of the lesion was not related to cortisol secretion, but frontal damage (anterior lesion) was associated with higher cortisol levels at the time of the morning peak (7:00 am) when compared to more posterior damage. there was no significant correlation between basal circulating levels of cortisol and emotional states in patients and healthy subjects. the results of this study suggest that hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (hpa) axis dysregulation is associated with unilateral injury particularly in frontal areas. these results, obtained in a human population, go along with recent animal studies reporting an implication of frontal regions in hpa activity.",Tchiteya BM,2003,Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0306-4530(02)00050-1,12727134,Tchiteya BM; Lecours AR; Elie R; Lupien SJ,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D001480: Basal Ganglia Diseases; D001925: Brain Damage, Chronic; D001931: Brain Mapping; D002940: Circadian Rhythm; D004292: Dominance, Cerebral; D004644: Emotions; D005260: Female; D005625: Frontal Lobe; D006801: Humans; D006854: Hydrocortisone; D007030: Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009415: Nerve Net; D010913: Pituitary-Adrenal System; D012016: Reference Values",,,https://openalex.org/W2125171969,120,17,1,1690,292,8

(−)sulpiride, injected into the substantia nigra, antagonised the locomotor depression although the partial antagonism of the elevation in the level of dopamine in the striatum and of the reduction in levels of dopac did not achieve significance. the specificity of the action of tetralin on dopamine receptors was shown by the failure of prazosin and yohimbine to antagonise the locomotor depression induced by tetralin and the reduction in levels of dopac. the selectivity of the action of tetralin for the dopamine system was shown by its failure to affect levels of noradrenaline, serotonin and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid in the striatum. the injection of tetralin into the substantia nigra also caused biochemical changes in limbic areas (nucleus accumbens and tuberculum olfactorium), where the levels of dopamine and dopac were elevated, and in the frontal cortex where the levels of dopac were reduced. these changes were antagonised by a concomitant injection of (−)sulpiride into the substantia nigra. it is concluded that the action of dopamine agonists in the midbrain can decrease the functional activity in the ascending dopaminergic pathways.",Bradbury AJ,1985,Neuropharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1016/0028-3908(85)90148-0,4094652,Bradbury AJ; Costall B; Kelly ME; Naylor RJ; Smith JA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D015102: 3,4-Dihydroxyphenylacetic Acid; D000818: Animals; D004298: Dopamine; D007276: Injections, Intraventricular; D008297: Male; D008636: Mesencephalon; D051379: Mice; D009043: Motor Activity; D009638: Norepinephrine; D012701: Serotonin; D013378: Substantia Nigra; D013764: Tetrahydronaphthalenes; D015016: Yohimbine",,,https://openalex.org/W1989913922,124,19,1,1401,228,7
false,ca1 pyramid-pyramid connections in rat hippocampus in vitro: dual intracellular recordings with biocytin filling,"in adult rat hippocampus, simultaneous intracellular recordings from 989 pairs of ca1 pyramidal cells revealed nine monosynaptic, excitatory connections. six of these pairs were sufficiently stable for electrophysiological analysis. mean excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude recorded at a postsynaptic membrane potential between −67 and −70 mv was 0.7 ± 0.5 mv (0.17–1.5 mv), mean 10–90% rise time was 2.7 ± 0.9 ms (1.5–3.8 ms) and mean width at half-amplitude was 16.8 ± 4.1 ms (11.6-25 ms). cells were labelled with biocytin and identified histologically. for one pair that was fully reconstructed morphologically, excitatory postsynaptic potential average amplitude was 1.5 mv, 10–90% rise time 2.8 ms and width at half-amplitude 11.6 ms (at -67 mv). in this pair, correlated light and electron microscopy revealed that the presynaptic axon formed two synaptic contacts with third-order basal dendrites of the postsynaptic pyramid, one with a dendritic spine, the other with a dendritic shaft. in the four pairs tested, postsynaptic depolarization increased excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude and duration. in two, d-2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (50 μm) reduced the amplitude and duration of the excitatory postsynaptic potential. the remainder of the excitatory postsynaptic potential now increased with postsynaptic hyperpolarization and was abolished by 20 μm 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (n = 1). paired-pulse depression was evident in the four excitatory postsynaptic potentials tested. this depression decreased with increasing inter-spike interval. these results provide the first combined electrophysiological and morphological illustration of synaptic contacts between pyramidal neurons in the hippocampus and confirm that connections between ca1 pyramidal neurons are mediated by both n-methyl-d-aspartate and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionate/kainate receptors.",Deuchars J,1996,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/0306-4522(96)00251-5,8895869,Deuchars J; Thomson AM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D015763: 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate; D000818: Animals; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D005071: Evoked Potentials; D018690: Excitatory Amino Acid Agonists; D018691: Excitatory Amino Acid Antagonists; D006624: Hippocampus; D008239: Lysine; D008297: Male; D008564: Membrane Potentials; D016202: N-Methylaspartate; D017966: Pyramidal Cells; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D013569: Synapses",,,https://openalex.org/W2044777055,112,15,1,1913,289,12

true,modulation of the antidepressant-like effects of sustained administration of carisbamate and lamotrigine on monoaminergic systems: electrophysiological studies in the rat brain,"carisbamate and lamotrigine are anticonvulsants that act on neuronal voltage-gated sodium channels. carisbamate has shown antidepressant-like effects in animal models of depression, and lamotrigine is a mood stabilizer with a therapeutic effect in depressive episodes of patients with bipolar disorder. this study examined the effects of carisbamate and lamotrigine on monoaminergic transmission in rodents, which could contribute to their antidepressant action. in vivo electrophysiological recordings were carried out in rats after 2 and 14 days administration of vehicle, carisbamate (60 mg/kg daily), or lamotrigine (25 mg/kg daily). overall firing activity of the dorsal raphe nucleus (drn) serotonin (5-ht), locus coeruleus norepinephrine, and ventral tegmental area dopamine (da) neurons was decreased with carisbamate. lamotrigine also decreased 5-ht neuronal firing, and this effect was abolished by lesion of the prefrontal cortex. despite these decreases in firing activity after their prolonged administration, both anticonvulsants exhibited a significant increase in tonic activation of hippocampus 5-ht1a receptors, as shown by a disinhibition of the firing activity of pyramidal neurons in response to the selective antagonist way-100635 (n-{2-[4(2-methoxyphenyl)-1-piperazinyl] ethyl}-n-(2-pyridinyl) cyclohexanecarboxamide trihydrochloride). this finding reveals an increase in the 5-ht level that may be attributed to a desensitization of the terminal 5-ht1b autoreceptors. this study demonstrates that sustained carisbamate and lamotrigine administration decreases 5-ht firing in the drn but nevertheless enhances 5-ht transmission in the forebrain. this serotonergic effect may be associated with an antiglutamatergic action and may contribute to the antidepressant-like effect of carisbamate in the forced swim test and the antidepressant properties of lamotrigine.",Shim S,2013,J Pharmacol Exp Ther,https://doi.org/10.1124/jpet.113.203315,23986541,Shim S; El Mansari M; Blier P,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D000928: Antidepressive Agents; D015306: Biogenic Monoamines; D001921: Brain; D056654: CA3 Region, Hippocampal; D002219: Carbamates; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D000077213: Lamotrigine; D008125: Locus Coeruleus; D008297: Male; D009474: Neurons; D011903: Raphe Nuclei; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D055366: Synaptic Potentials; D014227: Triazines; D017557: Ventral Tegmental Area",,,https://openalex.org/W2065498651,176,22,1,1886,294,10

false,positive and negative contractile effects of somatostatin-14 on rat ventricular cardiomyocytes,"somatostatin-14 elicits negative inotropic and chronotropic actions in atrial myocardium. less is known about the effects of somatostatin-14 in ventricular myocardium. the direct contractile effects of somatostatin-14 were assessed using ventricular cardiomyocytes isolated from the hearts of adult rats. cells were stimulated at 0.5 hz with cacl2 (2 mm) under basal conditions and in the presence of the beta-adrenoceptor agonist, isoprenaline (1 nm), or the selective inhibitor of the transient outward current (ito), 4-aminopyridine (500 microm). somatostatin-14 did not alter basal contractile response but it did inhibit (ic50 = 13 nm) the response to isoprenaline (1 nm). in the presence of 4-aminopyridine (500 microm), somatostatin-14 stimulated a positive contractile response (ec50 = 118 fm) that was attenuated markedly by diltiazem (100 nm). these data indicate that somatostatin-14 exerts dual effects directly in rat ventricular cardiomyocytes: (1) a negative contractile effect, observed in the presence of isoprenaline (1 nm), coupled to activation of ito; and (2) a previously unreported and very potent positive contractile effect, unmasked by 4-aminopyridine (500 microm), coupled to the influx of calcium ions via l-type calcium channels. the greater potency of somatostatin-14 for producing the positive contractile effect indicates that the peptide may exert a predominantly stimulatory influence on the resting contractility of ventricular myocardium in vivo, whereas the negative contractile effect, observed at much higher concentrations, could indicate that localized elevations in the concentration of the peptide may serve as a negative regulatory influence to limit the detrimental effects of excessive stimulation of cardiomyocyte contractility.",Murray F,2001,J Cardiovasc Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1097/00005344-200103000-00011,11243423,Murray F; Bell D; Kelso EJ; Millar BC; McDermott BJ,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D015761: 4-Aminopyridine; D000818: Animals; D020746: Calcium Channels, L-Type; D002316: Cardiotonic Agents; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D008297: Male; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D015221: Potassium Channels; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013004: Somatostatin; D013268: Stimulation, Chemical",,,https://openalex.org/W1975657868,94,11,1,1775,296,8
false,protein turnover in skeletal muscle,"to determine the mechanism by which denervation leads to atrophy of skeletal muscle, the fate of previously labeled protein was studied in denervated and contralateral control muscles of hypophysectomized rats.to label muscle proteins, a single injection of ah-leucine was given to the animals 2 days prior to section of the sciatic nerve.on subsequent days, the animals received unlabeled leucine and a high protein diet.protein degradative rates were estimated from the disappearance of radioactivity from muscle proteins.protein synthetic rates were estimated from the decrease in specific activity of these proteins, caused by the dilution of labeled proteins with newly synthesized (unlabeled) material.ten days after denervation, atrophic muscles contained less total radioactivity than contralateral controls.this result suggests increased protein degradation.nevertheless, the specific activity of muscle proteins remained unchanged.protein synthesis therefore must also have decreased following nerve section.the loss of muscle weight following denervation appeared to be directly proportional to the increase in protein degradation.the increase in catabolism of myofibrillar proteins was especially marked, and this tinding accounts for the relative loss of myofibrillar material in the denervated muscles.analogous experiments were carried out to determine the mechanisms through which cortisone induces muscle atrophy.two days after injection of labeled leucine, animals received daily injections of cortisone acetate (10 mg per day) or 0.9% sodium chloride solution.cortisone caused marked atrophy of the plantaris muscle.although the hormone decreased appreciably the amount of labeled proteins per muscle, it did not alter their specific activity.thus cortisone both increased protein degradation and decreased protein synthesis.in contrast to denervatioa atrophy, cortisone-atrophy affected the breakdown of myofibrillar and soluble proteins similarly.cortisone did not cause appreciable loss of weight of the soleus muscle, in which the hormone did not significantly increase protein degradation.however, upon dener-",Goldberg AL,1969,J Biol Chem,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0021-9258(18)93117-0,5792658,Goldberg AL,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D003348: Cortisone; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D007930: Leucine; D009121: Muscle Denervation; D009124: Muscle Proteins; D009132: Muscles; D009133: Muscular Atrophy; D009210: Myofibrils; D010902: Pituitary Gland; D051381: Rats; D012584: Sciatic Nerve; D012995: Solubility; D013997: Time Factors; D014316: Tritium",,,https://openalex.org/W1562155085,35,5,1,2133,300,1

false,integrated quality control project: relationships between pathological findings detected at the slaughterhouse and information gathered in a veterinary health scheme at pig farms,"in september 1986 an integrated quality control project (iqc) was started in the netherlands. over a period of 2 years a veterinary herd health scheme was applied to 21 growing and finishing pig herds. information was collected concerning medical treatment, classified as group treatment and individual treatment, clinical observations, and housing factors. the main purpose of this project was to investigate relationships between pathological findings detected at the slaughterhouse and information gathered on the farm. medical group treatments, clinical observations and housing did not reliably predict pathological findings. individual medical treatment for respiratory disorders, started in the last 30 days before slaughter, proved to be positively related to the pathological findings 'pneumonia' and 'pleuritis' detected at the slaughterhouse. this may be useful for selecting pigs at the slaughterhouse that will require special treatment for the removal of the pleura parietalis. during the first year of the project the average daily gain (adg) was 27.2 g. more than during the preceding 2 years (p < 0.0001). coughing was negatively related with the adg. more than 75 coughs per compartment during 10 minutes, recorded more than 50 days before slaughter, was positively related to a depression of the adg (20 g; p < 0.05). relationships between group medical treatments and adg were statistically significant, when the group medical treatment was started more than 20 days before slaughter. negative influences on the adg were higher if the treatment was started closer to the slaughter date.(abstract truncated at 250 words)",Blocks GH,1994,Vet Q,https://doi.org/10.1080/01652176.1994.9694432,7985354,Blocks GH; Vernooy JC; Verheijden JH,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000003: Abattoirs; D000822: Animal Husbandry; D000818: Animals; D000907: Antibodies, Bacterial; D000914: Antibodies, Viral; D003625: Data Collection; D011786: Quality Control; D013552: Swine; D013553: Swine Diseases; D015430: Weight Gain",,,https://openalex.org/W2058890096,178,24,1,1639,281,13
false,temazepam triggers the release of vasopressin into the rat hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus: novel insight into benzodiazepine action on hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenocortical system activity during stress,"we investigated the influence of a representative classical benzodiazepine on the regulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenocortical (hpa) axis activity both under basal conditions and stress. adult male wistar rats were intravenously administered with temazepam (0.5, 1, and 3 mg/kg body weight) and plasma concentrations of corticotropin (acth) and vasopressin (avp) were measured in blood samples collected via chronically implanted jugular venous catheters. simultaneously, the release of avp within the hypothalamic paraventricular nucleus (pvn) was monitored via microdialysis. plasma avp levels remained unaffected by the different treatment conditions. temazepam blunted the stressor exposure-induced secretion of acth in a dose-dependent manner. concurrently, and also in a dose-dependent manner temazepam enhanced the intra-pvn release of avp, known to originate from magnocellular neurons of the hypothalamic neurohypophyseal system. furthermore, temazepam did not affect the in vitro secretion of acth from the adenohypophyseal cells. taken together, the results of this study suggest that temazepam modulates the central nervous regulation of the hpa axis by altering intra-pvn avp release. an increasingly released avp of magnocellular origin seems to provide a negative tonus on acth secretion most probably via inhibiting the release of acth secretagogues from the median eminence into hypophyseal portal blood.",Welt T,2006,Neuropsychopharmacology,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.npp.1301006,16395302,Welt T; Engelmann M; Renner U; Erhardt A; Müller MB; Landgraf R; Holsboer F; Keck ME,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000305: Adrenal Cortex Hormones; D000324: Adrenocorticotropic Hormone; D000818: Animals; D001008: Anxiety Disorders; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D045604: Extracellular Fluid; D018757: GABA Modulators; D007030: Hypothalamo-Hypophyseal System; D008297: Male; D008473: Median Eminence; D017551: Microdialysis; D010286: Paraventricular Hypothalamic Nucleus; D010902: Pituitary Gland; D010913: Pituitary-Adrenal System; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D013693: Temazepam; D014667: Vasopressins",,,https://openalex.org/W2007896574,208,24,1,1432,221,9

false,adrenergic and serotoninergic mechanisms in gastric secretion in rats,"abstract: the influence of adrenergic and serotoninergic mechanisms on gastric secretion was investigated using fistula‐ and pylorus‐ligated rats. secretion was increased by the tyrosine hydroxylase inhibitor α‐methyltyrosine. this effect could be reversed by l‐dopa. 6‐hydroxydopamine also increased gastric output. the tryptophane hydroxylase inhibitor p ‐chlorophenylalanine reduced gastric output and abolished the increase in gastric secretion induced by α‐methyltyrosine. the antisecretory effect of serotonin was found to be antagonized by α‐methyltyrosine. pre‐treatment with 6‐hydroxydopamine also diminished the anti‐secretory effect of serotonin. the results indicate the possibility of the existence of an inhibiting peripheral adrenergic tonus in the regulation of gastric secretion in rats. furthermore it is suggested, that the anti‐secretory effect of large doses of serotonin may be due to displacement of noradrenaline in catecholamine neurones. finally the question is raised whether a balance between serotoninergic and adrenergic mechanisms in the regulation of gastric secretion may exist in rats.",Fjalland B,1973,Acta Pharmacol Toxicol (Copenh),https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1600-0773.1973.tb01513.x,4271165,Fjalland B,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000818: Animals; D002395: Catecholamines; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004295: Dihydroxyphenylalanine; D010134: Fenclonine; D005747: Gastric Fistula; D005750: Gastric Juice; D006892: Hydroxydopamines; D008297: Male; D008781: Methyltyrosines; D011708: Pylorus; D051381: Rats; D012701: Serotonin; D013268: Stimulation, Chemical; D013270: Stomach; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2094069869,69,9,1,1119,160,10

true,a role for 2-arachidonoylglycerol and endocannabinoid signaling in the locomotor response to novelty induced by olfactory bulbectomy,"bilateral olfactory bulbectomy (obx) in rodents produces behavioral and neurochemical changes associated clinically with depression and schizophrenia. most notably, obx induces hyperlocomotion in response to the stress of exposure to a novel environment. we examined the role of the endocannabinoid system in regulating this locomotor response in obx and sham-operated rats. in our study, obx-induced hyperactivity was restricted to the first 3 min of the open field test, demonstrating the presence of novelty (0–3 min) and habituation (3–30 min) phases of the open field locomotor response. levels of the endocannabinoids 2-arachidonoylglycerol (2-ag) and anandamide were decreased in the ventral striatum, a brain region deafferented by obx, whereas cannabinoid receptor densities were unaltered. in sham-operated rats, 2-ag levels in the ventral striatum were negatively correlated with distance traveled during the novelty phase. thus, low levels of 2-ag are reflected in a hyperactive open field response. this correlation was not observed in obx rats. conversely, 2-ag levels in endocannabinoid-compromised obx rats correlated with distance traveled during the habituation phase. in obx rats, pharmacological blockade of cannabinoid cb1 receptors with either am251 (1 mg kg−1 i.p.) or rimonabant (1 mg kg−1 i.p.) increased distance traveled during the habituation phase. thus, blockade of endocannabinoid signaling impairs habituation of the hyperlocomotor response in obx, but not sham-operated, rats. by contrast, in sham-operated rats, effects of cb1 antagonism were restricted to the novelty phase. these findings suggest that dysregulation in the endocannabinoid system, and 2-ag in particular, is implicated in the hyperactive locomotor response induced by obx. our studies suggest that drugs that enhance 2-ag signaling, such as 2-ag degradation inhibitors, might be useful in human brain disorders modeled by obx.",Eisenstein SA,2010,Pharmacol Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.phrs.2009.12.013,20044005,Eisenstein SA; Clapper JR; Holmes PV; Piomelli D; Hohmann AG,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D052061: Research Support, N.I.H., Extramural; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001095: Arachidonic Acids; D001345: Autoradiography; D063385: Cannabinoid Receptor Modulators; D002851: Chromatography, High Pressure Liquid; D003511: Cyclohexanols; D003720: Densitometry; D004298: Dopamine; D063388: Endocannabinoids; D004777: Environment; D005989: Glycerides; D008032: Limbic System; D050356: Lipid Metabolism; D008297: Male; D013058: Mass Spectrometry; D009043: Motor Activity; D009830: Olfactory Bulb; D010880: Piperidines; D011720: Pyrazoles; D019275: Radiopharmaceuticals; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D043884: Receptor, Cannabinoid, CB1; D000077285: Rimonabant; D015398: Signal Transduction",,,https://openalex.org/W2060377735,132,17,1,1928,321,16

false,decreased basal despite enhanced agonist-stimulated effects of nitric oxide in 12-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rat,"this study examined both basal and agonist-stimulated effects of nitric oxide in rings of thoracic aorta and carotid artery from 12-week-old stroke-prone spontaneously hypertensive rats (shrsp) and compared them to those found in rings from normotensive wistar kyoto (wky) controls. acetylcholine-induced endothelium-dependent relaxation was found to be five-fold more sensitive in both male and female shrsp when compared with those from age- and sex-matched wky rats. in contrast, we found a reduction in the effects of basal nitric oxide in the shrsp rat. specifically, the ability of basal nitric oxide to depress contractile responses to phenylephrine was found to be reduced in vessels from shrsp when compared with those from wky rats. in addition, the endothelium-dependent depression of vasodilator responses to the nitric oxide donor, glyceryl trinitrate, was reduced in vessels from shrsp when compared to those from wky rats. thus, we have shown that the effects of basal nitric oxide are impaired in the shrsp rat at an age when the effects of agonist-stimulated nitric oxide are actually enhanced. this impairment may be related to the greater susceptibility of basal nitric oxide to destruction by superoxide anion which is known to be produced in excess in this model of hypertension.",Dowell FJ,1999,Eur J Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0014-2999(99)00511-7,10497904,Dowell FJ; Martin W; Dominiczak AF; Hamilton CA,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000109: Acetylcholine; D000818: Animals; D001013: Aorta, Thoracic; D002339: Carotid Arteries; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004730: Endothelium, Vascular; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D005260: Female; D008297: Male; D019331: NG-Nitroarginine Methyl Ester; D009569: Nitric Oxide; D005996: Nitroglycerin; D010656: Phenylephrine; D051381: Rats; D011918: Rats, Inbred SHR; D011921: Rats, Inbred WKY; D013045: Species Specificity; D014661: Vasoconstriction; D014662: Vasoconstrictor Agents; D014664: Vasodilation",,,https://openalex.org/W2021485645,134,15,1,1300,218,7
false,a postsynaptic interaction between dopamine d1and nmda receptors promotes presynaptic inhibition in the rat nucleus accumbens via adenosine release,"the mechanism underlying dopamine d1 receptor-mediated attenuation of glutamatergic synaptic input to nucleus accumbens (nacc) neurons was investigated in slices of rat forebrain, using whole-cell patch-clamp recording. the depression by dopamine of epscs evoked by single-shock cortical stimulation was stimulus-dependent. synaptic activation of nmda-type glutamate receptors was critical for this effect, because dopamine-induced epsc depressions were blocked by the competitive nmda receptor antagonist d/l-2-amino-5-phosphonopentanoate (ap5). application of nmda also depressed the epsc, and both this effect and the dopamine depressions were blocked by the a1 receptor antagonist 8-cyclopentyl-1,3-dipropylxanthine (dpcpx), implicating adenosine release in the epsc depression. a1 receptor agonists also depressed epscs by a presynaptic action, causing increased paired-pulse facilitation, but this was insensitive to ap5. activation of d1 receptors enhanced both postsynaptic inward currents evoked by nmda application and the isolated nmda receptor-mediated component of synaptic transmission. the biochemical processes underlying the dopamine-induced epsc depression did not involve either protein kinase a or the production of camp and its metabolites, because this effect was resistant to the protein kinase inhibitors h89 and h7 and the camp-specific phosphodiesterase inhibitor rolipram. we conclude that activation of postsynaptic d1 receptors enhances the synaptic activation of nmda receptors in nucleus accumbens neurons, thereby promoting a transsynaptic feedback inhibition of glutamatergic synaptic transmission via release of adenosine. unusually for d1 receptors, this phenomenon occurs independently of adenylyl cyclase stimulation. this process may contribute to the locomotor stimulant action of dopaminergic agents in the nacc.",Harvey J,1997,J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.1523/jneurosci.17-14-05271.1997,9204911,Harvey J; Lacey MG,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D015763: 2-Amino-5-phosphonovalerate; D000241: Adenosine; D000818: Animals; D004298: Dopamine; D008297: Male; D009714: Nucleus Accumbens; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D017447: Receptors, Dopamine D1; D016194: Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W1948376754,158,27,1,1852,265,10
true,neuroprotective effect of chronic verapamil treatment on cognitive and noncognitive deficits in an experimental alzheimer's disease in rats,"abstractit is well known that disturbance of calcium homeostasis has a significant role in the development of neurodegenerative disorders, such as alzheimer's disease (ad). our recent data suggest that acute treatment with the calcium antagonist verapamil can improve some behavioral deficits in an experimental model of ad. therefore, the present study was done to establish the effect of chronically administered verapamil on cognitive and noncognitive behavior of rats with bilateral electrolitical lesions of nucleus basalis manocellularis (nbm)—an animal model of ad. the nbm lesions produce a deficit in performance of diverse behavior tests: active avoidance (aa), low level of fear (the open field test) as well as aggressive (the test of foot-shock induced aggression) and depressive (the learned helplesness test) behavior. verapamil (1.0, 2.5, 5.0 and 10.0 mg/kg i.p.) or saline solution (1 ml/kg i.p.) were injected 24 hr after the lesion of nbm and then repeatedly administered during the next 8 days (twice a day). performance of the two-way active avoidance test, the open field test, the foot shock-induced aggression test and the learned helplessness test were done on day 4 after the last verapamil or saline treatment (day 13 after the lesion). verapamil in doses of 2.5 and 5.0 mg/kg significantly ameliorated the deficit in the performance of aa, the open field behavior, and the depression, but not the aggressive behavior. the obtained beneficial effect of chronic administered verapamil suggests that the regulation of calcium homeostasis during the early period after nbm lesions might be a reasonable way to prevent the behavioral deficits in an experimental model of ad.key words: alzheimer's diseasenucleus basalis magnocellularistwo-way active avoidanceopen fieldfoot-shock aggressionlearned helplessnesschronic verapamil treatmentneuroprotectionrats",Popović M,1997,Int J Neurosci,https://doi.org/10.3109/00207459708986392,9522258,Popović M; Caballero-Bleda M; Popović N; Bokonjić D; Dobrić S,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000374: Aggression; D000544: Alzheimer Disease; D000818: Animals; D001362: Avoidance Learning; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D003072: Cognition Disorders; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004597: Electroshock; D006380: Helplessness, Learned; D008297: Male; D018696: Neuroprotective Agents; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D013377: Substantia Innominata; D014700: Verapamil",,,https://openalex.org/W2101388439,139,19,1,1879,317,10
false,coeruleotrigeminal suppression of nociceptive sensorimotor function during inflammation in the craniofacial region of the rat,"descending action from the locus coeruleus (lc) on the trigeminal sensorimotor function was evaluated in a rat model of oral-facial inflammation. for the induction of oral-facial inflammation, mustard oil (20% solution in 20microl mineral oil) was injected into the region of the temporomandibular joint (tmj). one week before testing, rats received bilateral lesions of the lc using a cathodal current. the electromyogram (emg) threshold, which is the threshold intensity for the onset of emg activity of the masseter muscle evoked by pressure on the tmj region, was used in the present study as an indicator of the trigeminal sensorimotor function. following mustard oil injection, in the lc-lesioned rats, emg thresholds significantly decreased at 30min, which lasted up to 240min. in contrast, emg thresholds in the lc-intact rats returned to the level before injection after 180min. systemic naloxone (1.3mg/kg, i.v.) produced a further decrease of emg thresholds in both the lc-intact and lc-lesioned rats. under the existence of naloxone, emg thresholds in the lc-lesioned rats were significantly lower than those of the lc-intact rats. these results suggest that oral-facial inflammation activates the coeruleotrigeminal modulating system and that an action of this system is independent of the opioid depressive mechanism.",Matsutani K,2003,Brain Res Bull,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0361-9230(03)00063-7,12788209,Matsutani K; Tsuruoka M; Shinya A; Furuya R; Kawawa T; Inoue T,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D004576: Electromyography; D007249: Inflammation; D007270: Injections, Intra-Articular; D008125: Locus Coeruleus; D008297: Male; D009149: Mustard Plant; D009270: Naloxone; D009292: Narcotic Antagonists; D017288: Pain Threshold; D010812: Physical Stimulation; D010936: Plant Extracts; D010938: Plant Oils; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013704: Temporomandibular Joint; D013997: Time Factors; D014278: Trigeminal Nuclei",,,https://openalex.org/W2045818125,125,15,1,1331,229,10
false,a natural model of behavioral depression in postpartum adult female cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis).,"postpartum depression (ppd) is a modified form of major depressive disorders (mdd) that can exert profound negative effects on both mothers and infants than mdd. within the postpartum period, both mothers and infants are susceptible; but because ppd typically occurs for short durations and has moderate symptoms, there exists challenges in exploring and addressing the underlying cause of the depression. this fact highlights the need for relevant animal models. in the present study, postpartum adult female cynomolgus monkeys (macaca fascicularis) living in breeding groups were observed for typical depressive behavior. the huddle posture behavior was utilized as an indicator of behavioral depression postpartum (bdp) as it has been established as the core depressive-like behavior in primates. monkeys were divided into two groups: a bdp group (n=6), which were found to spend more time huddling over the first two weeks postpartum than other individuals that formed a non-depression control group (n=4). the two groups were then further analyzed for locomotive activity, stressful events, hair cortisol levels and for maternal interactive behaviors. no differences were found between the bdp and control groups in locomotive activity, in the frequencies of stressful events experienced and in hair cortisol levels. these findings suggested that the postpartum depression witnessed in the monkeys was not related to external factors other than puerperium period. interestingly, the bdp monkeys displayed an abnormal maternal relationship consisting of increased infant grooming. taken together, these findings suggest that the adult female cynomolgus monkeys provide a natural model of behavioral postpartum depression that holds a number of advantages over commonly used rodent systems in ppd modeling. the cynomolgus monkeys have a highly-organized social hierarchy and reproductive characteristics without seasonal restriction-similar to humans-as well as much greater homology to humans than rodents. as such, this model may provide a greater translational efficiency and research platform for systematically investigating the etiology, treatment, prevention of ppd.",Chu XX,2014,Dongwuxue Yanjiu,https://doi.org/10.11813/j.issn.0254-5853.2014.3.174,24866487,Chu XX; Dominic Rizak J; Yang SC; Wang JH; Ma YY; Hu XT,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001522: Behavior, Animal; D019052: Depression, Postpartum; D005260: Female; D006197: Hair; D006854: Hydrocortisone; D008252: Macaca fascicularis; D009043: Motor Activity; D011247: Pregnancy; D013312: Stress, Physiological",,,https://openalex.org/W291093718,109,17,1,2176,349,13

true,alterations in phospholipidomic profile in the brain of mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress,"depression is a worldwide disability disease associated with high morbidity and has increased dramatically in the last few years. the differential diagnosis and the definition of an individualized therapy for depression are hampered by the absence of specific biomarkers. the aim of this study was to evaluate the phospholipidomic profile of the brain and myocardium in a mouse model of depression induced by chronic unpredictable stress (cus). the lipidomic profile was evaluated by thin layer and liquid chromatography and mass spectrometry and lipid oxidation was estimated by fox ii assay. antioxidant enzyme activity and the oxidized/reduced glutathione (gsh/gssg) ratio were also evaluated. results showed that chronic stress affects primarily the lipid profile of the brain, inducing an increase in lipid hydroperoxides, which was not detected in the myocardium. a significant decrease in phosphatidylinositol (pi) and in cardiolipin (cl) relative contents and also oxidation of cl and a significant increase of phosphatidylcholine (pc) and phosphatidylethanolamine (pe) were observed in the brain of mice after unpredictable chronic stress conditions. in the myocardium only an increase in pc content was observed. nevertheless, both organs present a decreased gsh/gssg ratio when compared to control groups, corroborating the occurrence of oxidative stress. the enzyme activities of catalase (cat) and superoxide dismutase (sod) were found to be decreased in the myocardium and increased in the brain, while glutathione reductase (gr) was decreased in the brain. our results indicate that in a mouse model for studying depression induced by cus, the modification of the expression of oxidative stress-related enzymes did not prevent lipid oxidation in organs, particularly in the brain. these observations suggest that depression has an impact on the brain lipidome and that further studies are needed to better understand lipids role in depression and to evaluate their potential as future biomarkers.",Faria R,2014,Neuroscience,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroscience.2014.04.042,24814727,Faria R; Santana MM; Aveleira CA; Simões C; Maciel E; Melo T; Santinha D; Oliveira MM; Peixoto F; Domingues P; Cavadas C; Domingues MR,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D001921: Brain; D002308: Cardiolipins; D002374: Catalase; D002908: Chronic Disease; D003866: Depressive Disorder; D004195: Disease Models, Animal; D005978: Glutathione; D019803: Glutathione Disulfide; D005980: Glutathione Reductase; D008297: Male; D008810: Mice, Inbred C57BL; D009206: Myocardium; D010084: Oxidation-Reduction; D010713: Phosphatidylcholines; D010714: Phosphatidylethanolamines; D010716: Phosphatidylinositols; D010743: Phospholipids; D013315: Stress, Psychological; D013482: Superoxide Dismutase; D035501: Uncertainty",,,https://openalex.org/W2010265433,121,17,1,2011,333,12

false,pharmacological characterization of an endogenous negative inotrophic factor (enif) from porcine heart.,"recently we have been successful in isolating an endogenous negative inotropic factor (enif) from porcine left ventricular tissue. in this study, we have characterized its pharmacological properties. the results of the study demonstrated that enif produces a concentration-dependent negative inotropic response on both guinea pig left atria and right ventricular trabeculae. the maximal reduction in contractile force produced by 300 ul of enif (5 ml bath) on atria and trabeculae were 90.0 +/- 0.8% and 77.5 +/- 6%. atria, however, was significantly more sensitive to enif than trabeculae. the ed 50 of enif for atria was found to be 38 ul as opposed to ed 50 of 100 ul of enif for trabeculae. acetylcholine (ach), a muscarinic receptor agonist, decreased the contractile force of guinea pig atria in a dose-dependent manner with a maximal decline in the contractile force of 90%. however, none of the concentration of ach used affected the contractile function of the trabeculae. atropine (1 um) completely blocked the negative inotropic response on atria of all the doses of ach used. the same dose of atropine, however, was unable to influence the negative inotropic effect of any of the doses of enif used on either the atria or trabeculae preparations in our study. the maximal decline in the contractile force of atria was e.g. 94 and 95% in the presence and absence of atropine respectively. these data demonstrate that the myocardial negative inotropic effect of enif is not mediated via the cholinegic receptor mechanism.",Zhang M,1998,Mol Cell Biochem,https://doi.org/10.1023/a:1006841511590,9546592,Zhang M; Paskvalin M; Khatter JC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000109: Acetylcholine; D000818: Animals; D001285: Atropine; D002316: Cardiotonic Agents; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D005260: Female; D006168: Guinea Pigs; D006321: Heart; D008297: Male; D018727: Muscarinic Antagonists; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D009206: Myocardium; D011976: Receptors, Muscarinic; D013552: Swine",,,https://openalex.org/W8224997,103,15,1,1531,280,13
false,mechanisms of termination of reentrant atrial arrhythmias by class i and class iii antiarrhythmic agents.,"we studied atrial flutter due to circus movement in chronically instrumented conscious dogs to identify the mechanism by which class i and class iii antiarrhythmic drugs terminate reentrant excitation. we used a crossover experimental design administering five class i agents and one class iii agent, by intravenous bolus followed by intravenous infusion. the class i agents other than lidocaine were almost uniformly effective in terminating the arrhythmia (disopyramide in six of seven dogs, propafenone in six of six, flecainide in seven of seven, and sc-40230 in seven of seven). termination was preceded by a marked increase in cycle length (ranging from +78% with propafenone to +55% with disopyramide), but with the exception of disopyramide, class i agents did not significantly shorten the excitable gap. with disopyramide the gap decreased from 49 +/- 3% to 28 +/- 3% of the cycle length. with no class i agent did the wavelength of effective refractoriness increase to approach the cycle length of the arrhythmia. lidocaine, used as a negative control, terminated the reentry in one dog with modest prolongation of the cycle length. terminations with class i agents correlated with depression of conduction rather than prolongation of refractoriness. in contrast with class i agents, d-sotalol prolonged the cycle length minimally (+10%) and terminated the arrhythmia in six of seven dogs. it decreased the excitable gap from 42 +/- 4% to 26 +/- 6% of the cycle, but it still did not cause the wavelength of effective refractoriness to equal the cycle length. terminations by d-sotalol seemed to result from either failure of the lateral boundaries of the circus path or reflection within the path.",Spinelli W,1989,Circ Res,https://doi.org/10.1161/01.res.65.6.1565,2510953,Spinelli W; Hoffman BF,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.",D000818: Animals; D000889: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; D004206: Disopyramide; D004285: Dogs; D004562: Electrocardiography; D005424: Flecainide; D006329: Heart Conduction System; D006339: Heart Rate; D008012: Lidocaine; D010880: Piperidines; D011405: Propafenone; D013015: Sotalol,,,https://openalex.org/W2080542032,105,16,1,1709,305,11
false,gabab-receptor modulation of short-term synaptic depression at an excitatory input to murine hippocampal ca3 pyramidal neurons,"gaba(b) agonists inhibit excitatory transmission to hippocampal ca3 neurons during low frequency stimulation. we examined whether gaba(b) receptor activation can also enhance synaptic efficacy, when investigated at an input with high initial release probability. short-term depression of field excitatory postsynaptic potential (epsp) amplitude was observed during trains of stimuli applied to associational/commissural inputs (10-50 hz; 22 degrees c). baclofen (10 microm) reduced the amplitude of initial epsps in a train, and also reduced the degree of short-term depression. epsps recorded late in a train were significantly larger in baclofen than those recorded in control solution. these dual effects were mimicked by another selective gaba(b) agonist (skf 97541, 10 microm), and abolished by a gaba(b)-selective antagonist (sch 50911, 20 microm). the effects of baclofen were similar at a higher recording temperature (32 degrees c), where short-term depression was observed at higher stimulation frequencies. these results are consistent with the idea that a reduction of transmitter release probability could increase the fidelity of high-frequency transmission at this input, an effect that could help account for excitatory effects of gaba(b) agonists in some seizure models.",Hoskison MM,2004,Neurosci Lett,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neulet.2004.04.050,15234471,Hoskison MM; Connor JA; Shuttleworth CW,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D019706: Excitatory Postsynaptic Potentials; D018755: GABA Agonists; D018756: GABA Antagonists; D008297: Male; D051379: Mice; D008839: Microelectrodes; D009434: Neural Pathways; D009924: Organ Culture Techniques; D017966: Pyramidal Cells; D018080: Receptors, GABA-B; D009435: Synaptic Transmission",,,https://openalex.org/W2058298658,126,16,1,1287,226,8
false,l-type calcium channels mediate mechanically induced bone formation in vivo,"abstract cell and tissue culture studies suggest that the long-lasting (l-type) voltage-sensitive calcium channels (vscc) play a role in the signaling cascade in bone cells after mechanical loading. we investigated whether the l-type vscc mediates mechanically induced bone formation in vivo using two l-type vscc antagonists verapamil and nifedipine. female sprague-dawley rats were divided into five groups: control group (veh), two verapamil-treated groups (20 mg/kg, vera-l; 100 mg/kg, vera-h), and two nifedipine-treated groups (20 mg/kg, nife-l; 100 mg/kg, nife-h). one bout of mechanical loading was applied to the right tibia 90 minutes after oral administration of verapamil or 30 minutes after oral administration of nifedipine. mechanical loading increased mineralizing surface (ms/bone surface [bs]), mineral apposition rate (mar), and bone formation rate (bfr/bs) on the endocortical surface in loaded tibias of control animals compared with nonloaded (left) tibias. verapamil and nifedipine suppressed the load-induced increase in bfr/bs observed in vehicle-treated controls by 56–61% (p &lt; 0.01) and 56–74% (p &lt; 0.01), respectively. yet, significant differences in ms/bs and bfr/bs between right and left limbs were found in verapamil- and nifedipine-treated animals, indicating that the treatments did not completely abolish load-induced bone formation. this study shows that blocking the l-type calcium channel in vivo substantially suppresses the mechanically induced increase in bone formation that normally would occur and suggests that the l-type calcium channel mediates mechanically induced bone adaptation in vivo.",Li J,2002,J Bone Miner Res,https://doi.org/10.1359/jbmr.2002.17.10.1795,12369783,Li J; Duncan RL; Burr DB; Turner CH,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D020746: Calcium Channels, L-Type; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D005260: Female; D009543: Nifedipine; D010012: Osteogenesis; D051381: Rats; D017207: Rats, Sprague-Dawley; D013314: Stress, Mechanical; D013977: Tibia; D014700: Verapamil",,,https://openalex.org/W2031070373,75,10,1,1651,285,8
false,body temperature depression and peripheral heat loss accompany the metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypoxia in low and high altitude birds,"the objectives of this study were to compare the thermoregulatory, metabolic and ventilatory responses to hypoxia of the high altitude bar-headed goose with low altitude waterfowl. all birds were found to reduce body temperature (t(b)) during hypoxia, by up to 1-1.5 degrees c in severe hypoxia. during prolonged hypoxia, t(b) stabilized at a new lower temperature. a regulated increase in heat loss contributed to t(b) depression as reflected by increases in bill surface temperatures (up to 5 degrees c) during hypoxia. bill warming required peripheral chemoreceptor inputs, since vagotomy abolished this response to hypoxia. t(b) depression could still occur without bill warming, however, because vagotomized birds reduced t(b) as much as intact birds. compared to both greylag geese and pekin ducks, bar-headed geese required more severe hypoxia to initiate t(b) depression and heat loss from the bill. however, when t(b) depression or bill warming were expressed relative to arterial o(2) concentration (rather than inspired o(2)) all species were similar; this suggests that enhanced o(2) loading, rather than differences in thermoregulatory control centres, reduces t(b) depression during hypoxia in bar-headed geese. correspondingly, bar-headed geese maintained higher rates of metabolism during severe hypoxia (7% inspired o(2)), but this was only partly due to differences in t(b). time domains of the hypoxic ventilatory response also appeared to differ between bar-headed geese and low altitude species. overall, our results suggest that birds can adjust peripheral heat dissipation to facilitate t(b) depression during hypoxia, and that bar-headed geese minimize t(b) and metabolic depression as a result of evolutionary adaptations that enhance o(2) transport.",Scott GR,2008,J Exp Biol,https://doi.org/10.1242/jeb.015958,18375857,Scott GR; Cadena V; Tattersall GJ; Milsom WK,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000531: Altitude; D000818: Animals; D001833: Body Temperature Regulation; D018481: Convection; D004372: Ducks; D005777: Geese; D000860: Hypoxia; D010100: Oxygen; D010101: Oxygen Consumption; D012123: Pulmonary Ventilation; D014628: Vagotomy,,,https://openalex.org/W2154838939,144,21,1,1775,341,11

false,hepatic extraction of indocyanine green is depressed early in sepsis despite increased hepatic blood flow and cardiac output,"• although active hepatocellular function is depressed during sepsis, it is not known whether this occurs in the very early stages of sepsis and whether it is due to depressed cardiac output or hepatic blood flow. to study this, rats were subjected to sepsis by cecal ligation and puncture and hepatocellular function was determined at various intervals thereafter by assessing the ability of the liver to clear different doses of indocyanine green. the indocyanine green concentration was continuously measured in vivo with a fiberoptic catheter and an in vivo hemo-reflectometer. maximal velocity and kinetic constant of the clearance of indocyanine green, hepatic blood flow, and cardiac output were determined in experimental and sham-operated rats. the results demonstrate that hepatic blood flow and cardiac output increased 2 to 10 hours after cecal ligation and puncture, while hepatocellular function (maximum velocity and kinetic constant) was decreased even 2 hours following cecal ligation and puncture. no linear correlation between hepatocellular function and hepatic blood flow or cardiac output was found under such conditions. the extremely early depression in active hepatocellular function, despite the increased hepatic blood flow and cardiac output, may form the basis for cellular dysfunctions leading to multiple organ failure during sepsis.

false,elevated guanosine 3?:5?-cyclic monophosphate mediates the depression of nitrovasodilator reactivity in endothelium-intact blood vessels,"the influence of endothelium-derived nitric oxide (edno) on relaxation induced by the nitrovasodilators, sodium nitroprusside and sodium nitrite was assessed in phenylephrine-stimulated hamster thoracic aortas, a preparation that displays significant basal release of edno. removal of the endothelium or treatment with the no synthase inhibitors, ng-nitro-l-arginine (l-nag, 10-30 microm) or ng-methyl-l-arginine (l-nmma; 100 microm) increased the potency and, except for sodium nitroprusside in endothelium-denuded segments, also increased the efficacy of the nitrovasodilators. removal of the endothelium had no effect on relaxations induced by isoproterenol, an indication that these effects were specific for the nitrovasodilators. removal of the endothelium, treatment of endothelium-intact preparations with l-nag or l-nmma, or exposure of these vessels to the guanylate cyclase inhibitor, methylene blue (10 microm) increased reactivity of the aortas to the guanosine 3':5'-cyclic monophosphate (cgmp) analogue, 8-br cgmp. measurement of cgmp revealed that endothelium-intact segments had a 6.5 fold higher level of cgmp than endothelium-denuded preparations and that sodium nitroprusside increased cgmp in both preparations by similar amounts in a concentration-dependent fashion. exposure of endothelium-denuded or l-nag-treated segments to sodium nitroprusside, to mimic the effects of basally released edno, depressed sodium nitrite and 8-br cgmp reactivity in a manner similar to endothelium-intact segments. these data indicate that edno increases cgmp levels in vascular smooth muscle and that the elevated cgmp levels depress nitrovasodilator and 8-br cgmp reactivities.",Jackson WF,1991,Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/bf00183010,1660105,Jackson WF; Busse R,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001013: Aorta, Thoracic; D001120: Arginine; D006224: Cricetinae; D006152: Cyclic GMP; D004730: Endothelium, Vascular; D008297: Male; D008647: Mesocricetus; D009569: Nitric Oxide; D019335: Nitroarginine; D009599: Nitroprusside; D012977: Sodium Nitrite; D014665: Vasodilator Agents; D019323: omega-N-Methylarginine",,,https://openalex.org/W2028307206,136,18,2,1685,254,7
false,electrophysiological studies on benzodiazepine antagonists,"the actions of the benzodiazepine (bdz) antagonists 3-hydroxymethyl-beta-carboline (3-hmc), ro 14-7437 and ro 15-1788 were tested on single cell activity of rat hypothalamic neurons in tissue cultures and on membrane properties of ca1 hippocampal pyramidal neurons in transverse slices. in addition, we examined the interactions of some of these agents with inhibitions elicited by gamma-aminobutyric acid (gaba) as well as the ability of ro 14-7437 to reverse the gaba-enhancing action of the bdz agonist flurazepam. bdz antagonists did not alter patterns of spontaneous activity of hypothalamic neurons and did not affect resting membrane potential or membrane conductance in ca1 pyramidal cells. ro 14-7437 either partially or totally reversed the potentiation by flurazepam of gaba-elicited depression of hypothalamic neuronal activity. small and inconsistent actions on gaba-mediated inhibitions of hypothalamic neurons were noted. electrically-elicited inhibitions of hypothalamic neurons were either not altered or slightly reduced. in the hippocampal slice, the frequency of spontaneous ipsps, the amplitude of stratum-radiatum evoked ipsps and the conductance increase caused by stratum-radiatum stimulation were either not altered or slightly reduced. these findings demonstrate that non-convulsant bdz antagonists block the action of bdz agonists in facilitating gaba and further that the presence of a bdz agonist is not required for these gaba-mediated events to occur. however, these experiments do not exclude a modulatory role for an endogenous bdz agonist on gaba-mediated events.",Krespan B,1984,Brain Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/0006-8993(84)90975-2,6424866,Krespan B; Springfield SA; Haas H; Geller HM,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013486: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.; D013487: Research Support, U.S. Gov't, P.H.S.","D000818: Animals; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D001570: Benzodiazepinones; D002243: Carbolines; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D004558: Electric Stimulation; D004594: Electrophysiology; D005442: Flumazenil; D005479: Flurazepam; D006624: Hippocampus; D007031: Hypothalamus; D007211: Indoles; D009433: Neural Inhibition; D009474: Neurons; D051381: Rats; D011919: Rats, Inbred Strains; D005680: gamma-Aminobutyric Acid",,,https://openalex.org/W2093958535,58,5,1,1597,244,9
false,"protective effect of deferoxamine on chromium(vi)-induced dna single-strand breaks, cytotoxicity, and lipid peroxidation in primary cultures of rat hepatocytes","incubation of primary cultures of rat hepatocytes with k2cr2o7 and deferoxamine (dfo), an iron chelator, resulted in a marked decrease in cellular levels of dna single-strand breaks caused by k2cr2o7. cellular treatment with dfo also suppressed both dichromate-induced cytotoxicity--evaluated by the leakage of lactate dehydrogenase, and lipid peroxidation--as monitored by malondialdehyde formation. in addition, treatment with dfo attenuated the suppression of the levels of vitamin e and c as well as the inhibition of alkaline phosphatase and glutathione peroxidase activity attributed to k2cr2o7. however, dfo had no influence on the cellular level of glutathione or the activity of glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase suppressed by dichromate. under the same experimental conditions, cellular uptake and distribution of chromium were not affected by dfo. these results indicate that dfo protects cells from chromium (vi)-induced dna strand breaks, cytotoxicity, lipid peroxidation, vitamin e and c depression, and glutathione peroxidase inhibition the role of antioxidants in chromium (vi)-induced cytotoxicity, dna breaks, and lipid peroxidation is discussed.",Susa N,1997,Arch Toxicol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s002040050397,9195015,Susa N; Ueno S; Furukawa Y; Sugiyama M,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D000469: Alkaline Phosphatase; D000818: Animals; D000931: Antidotes; D001205: Ascorbic Acid; D002424: Caustics; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D004249: DNA Damage; D004277: DNA, Single-Stranded; D003676: Deferoxamine; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D005978: Glutathione; D005979: Glutathione Peroxidase; D005980: Glutathione Reductase; D007770: L-Lactate Dehydrogenase; D015227: Lipid Peroxidation; D008099: Liver; D008297: Male; D008315: Malondialdehyde; D011192: Potassium Dichromate; D051381: Rats; D017208: Rats, Wistar; D013482: Superoxide Dismutase; D014810: Vitamin E",,,https://openalex.org/W2055260391,159,25,1,1177,192,6
