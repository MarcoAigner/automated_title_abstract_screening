false,economic outcomes associated with the use of risperidone in a naturalistic group practice setting.,"the purpose of this cohort pilot study was to compare the resource utilization and economic outcomes associated with the use of risperidone versus haloperidol in a naturalistic setting. patient charts from a large psychiatric group practice were reviewed, and hospital billing data were obtained. patients meeting the inclusion criteria were placed into one of two cohorts depending on their medication history. thirty patients treated with risperidone met the selection criteria, and a random quota sampling technique was used to allow for a matched control cohort of 30 patients treated with haloperidol. in the haloperidol and risperidone cohorts, 24 and 28 patients, respectively, were evaluated statistically. mean utilization rates and costs per patient per month for each service were estimated by using regression analysis. patients in the risperidone cohort had significantly fewer hospitalizations than did those in the haloperidol cohort (p = 0.004). likewise, risperidone patients had significantly lower hospitalization costs than haloperidol patients (p = 0.005). conversely, patients treated with risperidone visited the physician more frequently than did those treated with haloperidol (p = 0.0005). estimated mean total monthly costs were $123.34 lower (95% confidence interval = $464, $217) per patient in the risperidone cohort than in the haloperidol cohort ($1,636.11 vs $1759.45; p = 0.4693). significant reductions in hospital costs in the risperidone cohort offset higher medication and physician costs. overall, total monthly costs were similar for the two cohorts.",Nightengale BS,1998,Am J Manag Care,,10178498,Nightengale BS; Garrett L; Waugh S; Lawrence BJ; Andrus J,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D015331: Cohort Studies; D006123: Group Practice; D006801: Humans; D001523: Mental Disorders; D017063: Outcome Assessment, Health Care; D010865: Pilot Projects; D018967: Risperidone; D014481: United States; D014600: Utilization Review",,,https://openalex.org/W2406007387,98,15,1,1590,269,12
false,the effects of clozapine on cognitive functioning in schizophrenia.,"cognitive function may be markedly impaired in patients with schizophrenia; however, it has only recently been recognized as an important factor in determining patient outcome. research has shown that improvements in cognitive functioning occur independently of improvements in positive or negative clinical symptoms, and whereas typical antipsychotics may improve clinical symptoms, they have little or no efficacy in improving cognitive dysfunction. however, there is evidence that the atypical antipsychotic clozapine may improve this core deficit of schizophrenia. this review summarizes 12 published studies that assessed the effect of clozapine on cognitive functioning. as a group, these studies suggest that psychomotor speed, verbal fluency, and verbal learning and memory may be improved by treatment with clozapine. such cognitive improvements with clozapine treatment may offer an advantage to patients with schizophrenia by enhancing the possibility of better vocational functioning and quality of life.",McGurk SR,1999,J Clin Psychiatry,,10372607,McGurk SR,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D003024: Clozapine; D003071: Cognition; D003072: Cognition Disorders; D006801: Humans; D008568: Memory; D009483: Neuropsychological Tests; D012559: Schizophrenia; D012565: Schizophrenic Psychology; D014706: Verbal Learning; D014796: Visual Perception,,,https://openalex.org/W2288023518,67,10,1,1016,155,6

false,[clinical efficacy of olanzapine].,"the treatment of schizophrenic patients who fail adequate trials of typical neuroleptics is a major challenge. for these patients, the availability of atypical antipsychotics is a useful therapeutic advance. olanzapine shows a superior and broader spectrum of efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia, particularly its negative symptoms, with a substantially more favorable safety profile than conventional antipsychotic agents (e.g., haloperidol). however, little information on the clinical effects of olanzapine is available in japan. this article provides information on the efficacy of olanzapine for various symptoms of schizophrenic patients and drug safety. olanzapine is significantly superior to haloperidol in positive, negative, and depressive symptoms of patients, and for tardive dyskinesia and extrapyramidal symptoms. significantly greater improvement in avolition-apathy is achieved with olanzapine as compared to risperidone. these advantages are related to high affinity at the 5-ht2 binding site, no association with an alteration in dopamine a9 firing rates, and lower d2 striatal receptor blockade of olanzapine. treatment with 10 mg/day olanzapine is more appropriate for positive symptoms, and 12.5-17.5 mg/day olanzapine is more effective for negative symptoms. patients will need help adapting to a new level of functioning after a successful switch to olanzapine, and overcoming the disappointment that eventually occurs when the limitations of olanzapine become apparent.",Yui K,1999,Nihon Shinkei Seishin Yakurigaku Zasshi,,10495984,Yui K,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D001665: Binding Sites; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D003024: Clozapine; D065127: Dopamine D2 Receptor Antagonists; D006220: Haloperidol; D006801: Humans; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine; D018967: Risperidone; D012559: Schizophrenia; D012565: Schizophrenic Psychology; D055502: Secondary Prevention; D012701: Serotonin,,,https://openalex.org/W2414118720,34,7,1,1501,231,10

true,blood dyscrasias in clozapine-treated patients in italy.,"clozapine is a dibenzodiazepine derivative that is more effective than standard neuroleptic drugs in refractory schizophrenic patients, but its introduction in some countries was delayed by its propensity to cause blood dyscrasias. however, over the last ten years, different reports have clearly demonstrated that agranulocytosis and neutropenia can be easily prevented by means of strict hematologic surveillance. this article reviews the results of the first five years of the italian clozapine monitoring system (iclos).the hematologic parameters of 2,404 patients registered between 1995 and 1999 were collected in a central database, before the patients began clozapine-treatment, weekly for the first 18 weeks, and then monthly throughout the duration of therapy. on the basis of conventional criteria, different risk levels have been identified with total leukocyte <3. 0x10(9)/l and/or an absolute neutrophil count <1.5x10(9)/l leading to immediate discontinuation of the drug.the analysis shows that 0.9% of the patients developed neutropenia and 0.7% agranulocytosis, mainly during the first 18 weeks of clozapine treatment. drug discontinuation led to the normalization of hematologic parameters in all cases, and the use of growth factors reduced the risk of infectious complications. transient leukocytosis and eosinophilia were also observed but these did not have any serious clinical effects.the iclos study confirms that regular hematologic monitoring is highly effective in minimizing the incidence of clozapine-associated blood dyscrasias. the lower than initially expected rates of agranulocytosis and associated deaths are encouraging in view of the benefits of this drug in treatment-resistant schizophrenia and other neurologic disorders.",Lambertenghi Deliliers G,2000,Haematologica,,10702809,Lambertenghi Deliliers G,article,D016428: Journal Article,D000328: Adult; D000380: Agranulocytosis; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D003024: Clozapine; D004802: Eosinophilia; D005260: Female; D018756: GABA Antagonists; D016179: Granulocyte Colony-Stimulating Factor; D006801: Humans; D015994: Incidence; D007558: Italy; D007964: Leukocytosis; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009503: Neutropenia; D010265: Paraproteinemias; D012189: Retrospective Studies; D012307: Risk Factors; D012559: Schizophrenia; D012702: Serotonin Antagonists; D013921: Thrombocytopenia,,,https://openalex.org/W2143333002,56,8,1,1762,278,8

quality of evidence: most available data is gleaned from retrospective chart reviews and cohort studies. treatment recommendations are based on evidence from younger populations and a few anecdotal case reports and series involving elderly people.
main message: while relatively rare in the community setting, mania in old age frequently leads to hospitalization. it is associated with late-onset neurologic disorders (especially cerebrovascular disease) involving the right hemisphere and orbitofrontal cortex. prognosis is relatively poor; morbidity and mortality rates are high. management of bipolarity includes cautious use of mood stabilizers, especially lithium and divalproex.

methods: drug-utilisation survey conducted within the framework of a broader prospective follow-up study with 67 italian outpatient psychiatric services.
results: the data concern 2322 patients recruited over a 3-year period. three-quarters of the cohort were prescribed antipsychotic drugs, one-half received benzodiazepines and nearly one-third received antidepressants. the trends in drug use from 1994 to 1997 show that for patients with schizophrenia there has been a decrease in the prescription of typical neuroleptics: the use of haloperidol passed from 56% to 42.4% and that of chlorpromazine dropped from 13.5% to 6.1%; during the same period, an increasing use of the atypical compound risperidone was observed. among patients suffering from unipolar affective psychosis, the prescriptions of tricyclic antidepressants (tcas) and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (ssris) have not changed in time, while the proportion of patients receiving neuroleptic drugs has increased from 41% to 45.2%. in addition, the use of antiepileptic drugs and lithium increased, irrespective of diagnosis. almost 40% of the patients on psychotropic drugs received three or more drugs. finally, a positive association was found between the number of prescribed compounds and the daily dose administered.
conclusion: these data indicate that in the absence of a rational approach to drug use, a symptomatic approach is generally adopted, by which common sense, experience, information provided by non-independent agencies and other cultural parameters play an important role in the prescription strategy. pharmacoepidemiology should more often consider the use of drugs as a dependent variable, to be investigated within the context of other clinical, cultural, social and setting-related parameters; this approach would enable a more comprehensive assessment of prescribing practices and strategies in routine clinical care.",Tognoni G,1999,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s002280050694,10638400,Tognoni G,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016448: Multicenter Study,D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000554: Ambulatory Care Facilities; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D015331: Cohort Studies; D003156: Community Mental Health Services; D004363: Drug Utilization; D005260: Female; D005500: Follow-Up Studies; D006801: Humans; D007558: Italy; D008137: Longitudinal Studies; D008297: Male; D001523: Mental Disorders; D008875: Middle Aged,,,https://openalex.org/W2416095832,92,12,1,2044,332,11

false,atypical antipsychotic agents: a critical review,"the pharmacology, efficacy, and adverse effects of atypical antipsychotic agents when used to treat schizophrenia and other disorders are reviewed. atypical antipsychotic agents were developed in response to problems with typical agents, including lack of efficacy in some patients, lack of improvement in negative symptoms, and troublesome adverse effects, especially extrapyramidal symptoms (epss) and tardive dyskinesia ctd). atypical antipsychotics differ from typical psychotics in their ""limbic-specific"" dopamine type 2 (d2)-receptor binding and high ratio of serotonin type 2 (5-ht2)-receptor binding to d2 binding. in clinical trials in patients with non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia, risperidone and olanzapine were superior to placebo for positive and negative symptoms. risperidone and olanzapine were superior to haloperidol on some measures. quetiapine was better than placebo but was not better than typical antipsychotics. head-to-head comparisons of atypical antipsychotics in non-treatment-resistant schizophrenia have been inconclusive. clozapine remains the standard agent for treatment-resistant schizophrenia. atypical agents are substantially more expensive than their typical antipsychotic counterparts. to fully determine the overall efficiency of these drugs, other potential benefits, such as improved quality of life, need to be factored in. atypical antipsychotics are associated with a decreased capacity to cause epss, td, neuroleptic malignant syndrome, and hyperprolactinemia. clozapine carries a risk of agranulocytosis; the white blood cell count must be monitored. atypical antipsychotics are increasingly being used for indications other than schizophrenia, such as the management of aggression, mania, and depression. atypical antipsychotics are often considered first-line agents for treating schizophrenia and are promising treatment alternatives for other psychiatric and neurologic conditions.",Worrel JA,2000,Am J Health Syst Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/57.3.238,10674777,Worrel JA; Marken PA; Beckman SE; Ruehter VL,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D004347: Drug Interactions; D006801: Humans; D009422: Nervous System Diseases; D011954: Receptors, Dopamine; D011985: Receptors, Serotonin; D012559: Schizophrenia; D016896: Treatment Outcome",,,https://openalex.org/W1870664623,48,7,1,1940,292,14
false,dopamine d2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine or risperidone in young patients with schizophrenia,"a crucial characteristic of antipsychotic medication is the occupancy of the dopamine (da) d2 receptor. we assessed striatal da d2 receptor occupancy by olanzapine and risperidone in 36 young patients [31 males, 5 females; mean age 21.1 years (16-28)] with first episode schizophrenia, using [123i]iodobenzamide (ibzm) spect. the occupancy of da d2 receptors was not significantly different between olanzapine and risperidone. however, in subgroups of most prescribed doses, da d2 occupancy was higher in the risperidone 4-mg group (79%) compared to the olanzapine 15-mg group (62%). [123i]ibzm binding ratios decreased with olanzapine dose (r = -0.551; p < 0.01), indicating higher da d2 receptor occupancy with higher olanzapine dose. akathisia and positive symptoms were correlated with [123i]ibzm binding ratio (r = -0.442; p < 0.01; and r = -0.360; p < 0.05, respectively). prolactin (prl) levels were elevated in the risperidone, but not in the olanzapine group, at comparable d2 receptor occupancy levels. in the olanzapine group, prl levels were correlated with [123i]ibzm binding ratio (r = -0.551; p < 0.01). in conclusion, both olanzapine and risperidone induce a high striatal d2 receptor occupancy, dependent on dose and group formation. the lower incidence of prolactin elevation with olanzapine, compared to risperidone, may not be attributed to a lower d2 receptor occupancy.",Lavalaye J,1999,Psychiatry Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0925-4927(99)00032-3,10688158,Lavalaye J; Linszen DH; Booij J; Reneman L; Gersons BP; van Royen EA,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000293: Adolescent; D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001549: Benzamides; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D001921: Brain; D001931: Brain Mapping; D003287: Contrast Media; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007457: Iodine Radioisotopes; D008297: Male; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine; D011569: Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; D011759: Pyrrolidines; D017448: Receptors, Dopamine D2; D018967: Risperidone; D012559: Schizophrenia; D015899: Tomography, Emission-Computed, Single-Photon; D016896: Treatment Outcome",,,https://openalex.org/W2048766195,96,13,1,1391,274,10

false,olanzapine and clozapine: comparative effects on motor function in hallucinating pd patients.,"objective: to compare olanzapine and clozapine for safety and efficacy measures of psychosis and motor function in patients with pd and chronic hallucinations.
background: hallucinations occur in approximately one third of patients with pd treated chronically with dopaminergic drugs. although clozapine is known to be an effective antipsychotic agent that does not significantly exacerbate parkinsonism, its use requires frequent blood count assessment. olanzapine is another novel antipsychotic that is not associated with blood dyscrasia, and if equally effective could become the preferred drug for treating hallucinations in subjects with pd.
methods: a randomized, double-blind, parallel comparison of olanzapine and clozapine in patients with pd with chronic hallucinations was conducted. the primary outcome measure was the scale for the assessment of positive symptoms (saps) for psychotic symptoms. the unified parkinson's disease rating scale (updrs) motor subscale was used as a secondary outcome measure and as a safety monitoring tool.
results: after 15 patients had completed the study, safety stopping rules were invoked because of exacerbated parkinsonism in olanzapine-treated subjects. updrs motor impairment scores from baseline to study end significantly increased with olanzapine treatment, and change scores between the olanzapine and clozapine groups significantly differed. the primary clinical domains responsible for the motor decline were gait and bradykinesia. even with a smaller patient number than originally anticipated, clozapine significantly improved hallucinations and overall behavioral assessment, whereas olanzapine had no effect.
conclusions: at the doses studied, olanzapine aggravates parkinsonism in comparison with clozapine and should not be regularly used in the management of hallucinations in patients with pd.",Goetz CG,2000,Neurology,10.1212/wnl.55.6.789,10993997,Goetz CG; Blasucci LM; Leurgans S; Pappert EJ,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000368: Aged; D001519: Behavior; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D003024: Clozapine; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D005260: Female; D006212: Hallucinations; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009068: Movement; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010300: Parkinson Disease; D010890: Pirenzepine,,,,93,14,1,1863,286,12

the results are even more sobering given the fact that most of these trials were conducted in patients who had already had a history of partial response to typical antipsychotics—thus having an inherent bias against the older typical antipsychotics. on the other hand, prescription data suggest that atypical antipsychotics account for nearly three out of four new prescriptions for antipsychotics in north america. so, how can we reconcile this large shift in prescribing practices (at least in north america) with the sobering evidence provided by geddes et …",Kapur S,2000,BMJ,https://doi.org/10.1136/bmj.321.7273.1360,11099266,Kapur S; Remington G,article,D016420: Comment; D016421: Editorial,D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D006801: Humans; D011596: Psychomotor Disorders; D012559: Schizophrenia,,,https://openalex.org/W58391041,23,2,1,1191,201,6

false,ciprofloxacin increases serum clozapine and n-desmethylclozapine: a study in patients with schizophrenia,"objective: a possible pharmacokinetic interaction between a cyp1a2 inhibitor, ciprofloxacin, and clozapine was studied in schizophrenia patients with stable clozapine treatment.
methods: a randomised double-blind cross-over study design with two phases was used. seven schizophrenic inpatients volunteered to receive, in addition to their previous drug regimen, either 250 mg ciprofloxacin or placebo twice daily (b.i.d.) for 7 days. the phases were separated by a 7-day wash-out period. serum concentrations of clozapine and its main metabolite n-desmethylclozapine were measured during both phases before the first dose on day 1 and on days 3 and 8.
results: ciprofloxacin increased mean serum concentration of clozapine and n-desmethylclozapine by 29% (p < 0.01) and 31% (p < 0.05), respectively. there was a significant positive correlation (r = 0.90, p < 0.01) between the individual concentrations of serum ciprofloxacin and the increase in concentrations of clozapine plus n-desmethylclozapine. the increase in serum clozapine concentrations correlated significantly (r = 0.89, p < 0.01) with the ratios of n-desmethylclozapine to clozapine concentrations.
conclusion: even a low dose of ciprofloxacin can moderately increase serum concentrations of clozapine and n-desmethylclozapine. a probable mechanism of interaction is an inhibition of cyp1a2 enzyme by ciprofloxacin. the possibility of clinically significant interaction should be considered, especially when higher doses of ciprofloxacin are used concomitantly with clozapine.",Raaska K,2000,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s002280000192,11151749,Raaska K; Neuvonen PJ,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000328: Adult; D000890: Anti-Infective Agents; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D002939: Ciprofloxacin; D003024: Clozapine; D018592: Cross-Over Studies; D065609: Cytochrome P-450 CYP1A2 Inhibitors; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D004347: Drug Interactions; D004791: Enzyme Inhibitors; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007206: Individuality; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D010919: Placebos; D012559: Schizophrenia,,,https://openalex.org/W2048282464,104,13,1,1544,250,12

objective: to compare ziprasidone im 2 mg (n=38) and 20 mg (n=41) in the acute control and short-term management of agitated psychotic patients.
methods: a prospective, randomized, double-blind, 24-h study assessed efficacy using the behavioral activity rating scale (bars) and the panss. the bars is a validated rating scale for the assessment of treatment response in acute agitation associated with psychosis. following the initial dose, three more doses could be given 4 h apart if needed during the 24-h period.
results: the mean bars score had decreased 15 min after the first 20 mg im dose and was statistically significantly lower than the 2 mg group at 30 min post-dose. the improvement with the 20 mg dose increased until 2 h, and was maintained until at least 4 h post-dose (p<0.001). two hours after the first injection, almost all of the patients receiving ziprasidone 20 mg were bars responders compared with just one-third of those receiving 2 mg ziprasidone (p<0.001). the calming effect of ziprasidone was also evident by the significant reduction in panss agitation items (p<0.05) and cgi-severity at 4 h (p=0.008). both ziprasidone doses were very well tolerated. ziprasidone im 20 mg was not associated with eps, dystonia, akathisia, respiratory depression or with excessive sedation.

objectives: the aim of this study was to study attrition rates in randomised controlled trials of oral administration of conventional antipsychotic drugs, atypical antipsychotic drugs and placebo.
methods: the database of the schizophrenia module of the cochrane library was utilised for the present study. the data in the cochrane module are collected by identifying relevant randomised controlled trials from several electronic databases and other sources. number of dropouts was defined as patients leaving the study preterm due to any reason.
results: data from 328 treatment groups, consisting of 18,585 randomised subjects from 163 drug trials, were entered in the analysis. one-third of the subjects had dropped out of the trials. the dropout rates significantly increased for each calendar year. year of trial publication, type of drug and trial length remained statistically significant contributors to dropout rates. in a model incorporating year of publication and trial length, placebo groups and groups treated with conventional antipsychotics had significantly higher attrition rates than groups treated with atypical drugs. when clozapine-treated groups were excluded from the analysis, no statistically significant advantage for atypical drugs over conventional drugs remained.

method: 5-ht2a binding was estimated using 123i-5-i-r91150 and single photon emission tomography (spet) in six schizophrenic subjects treated with quetiapine at a mean (+/-sd) daily dose of 350+/-123 mg for at least 5 weeks and a matched sample of six healthy volunteers. clinical and side-effect ratings were performed at baseline and at the time of spet scanning. the reference region approach was used to define a 5-ht2a binding index in the frontal and temporal cortex.
results: quetiapine treatment resulted in a significant decline in 5-ht2a receptor availability in the frontal cortex (mean 0.98+/-0.09) relative to healthy volunteers (mean 1.33+/-0.16). all patients showed improvements in clinical symptom or side-effect ratings. the mean frontal cortex:cerebellum ratio after quetiapine treatment was significantly negatively correlated with reduction in the abnormal involuntary rating scale and simpson-angus scores (p<0.05 bonferroni corrected), but not with the reduction in the scores from the scale for the assessment of positive symptoms, the scale for the assessment of negative symptoms, the montgomery-asberg depression rating scale or patient age.

objective: the goal of this study was to compare the skin conductance response (which is peripherally mediated via muscarinic m3-receptors) and the inspiratory gasp response (which is peripherally mediated via adrenergic receptors) between healthy controls and schizophrenics treated with clozapine or olanzapine.
methods: twenty patients with schizophrenia (according to dsm-iii-r criteria) treated with either clozapine (200-500 mg/day) or olanzapine (10-20 mg/day) as well as ten matched controls underwent simultaneous recordings of the skin conductance response (scr) of sweat glands and of the inspiratory gasp response (igr) of acral blood vessels. a single, deep inspiration was used as the stimulus. group differences for the scr amplitudes and the post-igr redilation times were compared using the mann-whitney test.
results: both clozapine- and olanzapine-treated patients showed a significant scr reduction compared to controls. interestingly, the reduction in scr was significantly larger in the clozapine group compared to the olanzapine group (p<0.05). moreover, only clozapine-treated patients showed a statistical trend towards a longer igr redilation time compared to controls.
conclusion: the significantly stronger scr reduction amongst clozapine-treated compared to olanzapine-treated patients suggests that olanzapine at a standard clinical dose exhibits a significantly smaller anticholinergic effect at peripheral m3-receptors in vivo compared to clozapine. the prolongation of igr redilation can be explained by a prolonged release of noradrenaline due to the alpha2-antagonistic effect of clozapine.",Mueck-Weymann M,2001,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s002130100820,11605095,Mueck-Weymann M; Acker J; Agelink MW,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article,D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001341: Autonomic Nervous System; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D001808: Blood Vessels; D003024: Clozapine; D005260: Female; D005712: Galvanic Skin Response; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine; D012039: Regional Blood Flow; D015656: Respiratory Mechanics; D012559: Schizophrenia; D012867: Skin; D013545: Sweat Glands,,,https://openalex.org/W2044678743,121,17,1,1779,278,10
false,fluvoxamine as an adjunctive agent in schizophrenia,"abstract schizophrenia is a common mental disorder that has an early onset and rates high as a cause of medical disability. antipsychotic agents are the mainstay of treatment but response is often inadequate. negative symptoms (disturbances in volition, social interaction and affective functions) are particularly difficult to treat and form a major obstacle to rehabilitation. a promising approach to improve response of negative symptoms has been to add a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (ssri) antidepressant to antipsychotic treatment. this review examines evidence pertaining to the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of the ssri fluvoxamine, combined with antipsychotic agents, in the treatment of negative symptoms in schizophrenia. important methodological issues, such as differentiating primary and secondary negative symptoms, are discussed. the balance of available evidence indicates that fluvoxamine can improve primary negative symptoms in chronic schizophrenia patients treated with typical antipsychotic s and suggests that it may also do so in some patients treated with clozapine. this combination is generally safe and well tolerated although, as antipsychotic drug concentrations may be elevated, attention to dose and drug monitoring should be considered appropriately. combination with clozapine may require particular caution because of potential toxicity if serum clozapine levels rise steeply. the fluvoxamine doses effective in augmentation are lower than those usually used to treat depression. evidence regarding the use of fluvoxamine augmentation to treat phenomena, such as obsessions and aggression, which may be associated with schizo prenia, is also examined. an impartant goal of future studies will be to define which patint groups can benefit from combined treatment.",Silver H,2001,CNS Drug Rev,https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1527-3458.2001.tb00200.x,11607044,Silver H,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454: Review","D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D004347: Drug Interactions; D004359: Drug Therapy, Combination; D016666: Fluvoxamine; D006801: Humans; D012559: Schizophrenia; D017367: Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors",,,https://openalex.org/W2072816846,51,7,1,1813,283,12

false,mianserin or placebo as adjuncts to typical antipsychotics in resistant schizophrenia,"the beneficial effect of atypical antipsychotic drugs (apds) in treatment-resistant schizophrenia patients has been attributed, mostly, to their relatively high serotonergic (5-ht)2 to dopaminergic (d)2 receptor blockade ratio. we hypothesized that a combination of typical apds (d2 antagonists) and mianserin, a potent 5-ht2 antagonist, might also exert superior efficacy in this population. eighteen inpatients with treatment-resistant schizophrenia who had an acute psychotic exacerbation of the disorder received, in a double-blind design, 30 mg/day mianserin (n =9) or placebo (n =9) in conjunction with typical neuroleptics [haloperidol (n =9) or perphenazine (n =9)]. clinical status was evaluated before, during, and at the end of 6 weeks of combined treatment with the brief psychiatric rating scale (bprs), scale for the assessment of positive symptoms (saps), scale for the assessment of negative symptoms and hamilton rating scale for depression. the typical apd/mianserin group exhibited significantly greater improvement in total bprs scores (17.6% versus 5.5%;p =0.03) and a trend towards greater improvement in saps scores (35.3% versus 13.0%;p =0.07). our study indicates that patients with chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia who have an acute psychotic exacerbation (‘acute-on-chronic’) may benefit from the addition of a potent 5-ht2 blocker, such as mianserin, to typical antipsychotics. our findings may further emphasize the contribution of enhanced 5-ht2 blockade to the ‘atypicality’ of the atypical apds and to their greater efficacy in alleviating symptoms of chronic treatment-resistant schizophrenia.",Shiloh R,2002,Int Clin Psychopharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1097/00004850-200203000-00003,11890187,Shiloh R; Zemishlany Z; Aizenberg D; Valevski A; Bodinger L; Munitz H; Weizman A,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001480: Basal Ganglia Diseases; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D004351: Drug Resistance; D004359: Drug Therapy, Combination; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008803: Mianserin; D008875: Middle Aged; D011569: Psychiatric Status Rating Scales; D012559: Schizophrenia; D012565: Schizophrenic Psychology; D012702: Serotonin Antagonists",,,https://openalex.org/W2030038888,85,11,1,1635,288,7

objectives: this positron emission tomography (pet) study aimed to measure d(2) receptor occupancy in striatal and extra-striatal regions induced by clinically representative doses of sertindole in patients with schizophrenia.
method: four stabilized schizophrenic out-patients received sertindole 20 mg/day for 6-8 weeks. pet was performed using [(11)c]raclopride to measure d(2) receptor occupancy in the striatum and [(11)c]flb457 to measure occupancy in the neocortex and thalamus, i.e. regions with very low d(2) receptor density.
results: striatal d(2) receptor occupancy was 52-68%. similar occupancies were found in the thalamus, and the temporal and frontal cortices.
conclusions: sertindole appears efficacious at a low d(2) receptor occupancy, comparable to that produced by clozapine. this finding could explain the low risk of eps. the functional limbic selectivity of sertindole was not reflected in regional differences in receptor occupancy.",Nyberg S,2002,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1083-5,12107615,Nyberg S; Olsson H; Nilsson U; Maehlum E; Halldin C; Farde L,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D017427: Clinical Trial, Phase II; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D003342: Corpus Striatum; D005260: Female; D005625: Frontal Lobe; D006801: Humans; D007093: Imidazoles; D007211: Indoles; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D011485: Protein Binding; D017448: Receptors, Dopamine D2; D012559: Schizophrenia; D016037: Single-Blind Method; D013702: Temporal Lobe; D013788: Thalamus; D014055: Tomography, Emission-Computed",,,https://openalex.org/W2055569585,113,14,1,1281,227,12

objectives: we investigated whether the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone differ in their effects on inhibitory and excitatory cortical markers measured with transcranial magnetic stimulation.
methods: electromyographic recordings from the abductor pollicis brevis muscle were made during focal transcranial magnetic stimulation to the contralateral motor cortex and during bilateral cortical stimulation. twenty patients on each drug and 22 controls were studied with measures of the resting motor threshold, motor evoked potential size, post-excitatory silent period duration, cortical inhibition and facilitation to paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation and transcallosal inhibition.
results: the patient groups differed from the controls in the silent period and transcallosal inhibition measures, both of which assess cortical inhibitory activity. the two medication groups differed in the magnitude of the resting motor threshold and several measures of transcallosal inhibition that reflect the spread of inhibitory activity between hemispheres.
conclusions: these findings suggest that olanzapine and risperidone differ subtly in their effects on cortical inhibitory mechanisms. further evaluation is required to establish whether these differences may reflect or underlie differences seen between these medications in their clinical profiles, including their effects on cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia.",Fitzgerald PB,2002,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1068-4,12107621,Fitzgerald PB; Brown TL; Daskalakis ZJ; Kulkarni J,article,"D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D000704: Analysis of Variance; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D016009: Chi-Square Distribution; D004574: Electromagnetic Fields; D019054: Evoked Potentials, Motor; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D009044: Motor Cortex; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010361: Patients; D010890: Pirenzepine; D018967: Risperidone; D012559: Schizophrenia",,,https://openalex.org/W2024106280,148,20,1,1747,245,9

false,glucose intolerance with atypical antipsychotics,"background: previous studies have suggested that the atypical antipsychotics clozapine and olanzapine may be associated with an increased risk of glucose intolerance and diabetes mellitus. early studies have also suggested an association between use of conventional antipsychotics and the development of glucose intolerance.
objective: to examine quantitatively the association between glucose intolerance including diabetes mellitus and the use of the atypical antipsychotics clozapine, olanzapine or risperidone, and to identify possible risk factors for the development of glucose intolerance during treatment with these drugs.
methods: all reports suggestive of glucose intolerance for clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone were identified in the who database for adverse drug reactions. in the analyses of possible risk factors for glucose intolerance all other reports of adverse drug reactions for clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone were used as reference. using the bayesian confidence propagation neural network method, the strengths of the associations over time between glucose intolerance and the use of these drugs were analysed. for comparison, the strengths of the associations between glucose intolerance and the use of the conventional antipsychotics haloperidol and chlorpromazine were also analysed.
results: clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone were significantly associated with glucose intolerance. in contrast, chlorpromazine and haloperidol were not associated with glucose intolerance. for clozapine, olanzapine and risperidone grouped together, the following potential risk factors for glucose intolerance were identified: an underlying diabetic condition (odds ratio [or] 10.22, 95% ci 8.20-12.73), an increase in weight (or 2.36, 95% ci 1.76-3.17), male gender (or 1.27, 95% ci 1.11-1.47), and concomitant use of valproic acid (or 1.97, 95% ci 1.61-2.40), selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (or 1.63, 95% ci 1.33-1.99) or buspirone (or 2.24, 95% ci 1.33-3.77).

objective: the objective of this meta-regression analysis was to estimate the effect of potential moderators of placebo response in randomized, short-term clinical trials involving patients with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder.
methods: mean placebo response and potential moderators were extracted from 35 placebo-controlled, randomized trials of antipsychotic medications in patients with schizophrenia. placebo response was defined as the absolute change in the brief psychiatric rating scale total score. fixed-effects meta-regression was used to investigate between-trial variation in placebo response.
results: trial duration accounted for a substantial proportion of the between-trial variation in response (27%), with greater improvement on placebo observed in shorter trials. other variables showed insufficient variation across trials to permit any inferences regarding their relationships with placebo response.
conclusions: placebo-controlled trials of short duration (<6-8 weeks) are vulnerable to substantial placebo response. recruiting patients with more severe pathology to mitigate placebo response does not appear to offer benefits and may even be counterproductive. meta-analyses based on individual patient data offer the potential for much more detailed and inferentially sound exploration of factors affecting placebo response and are highly recommended.",Welge JA,2003,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1299-4,12494247,Welge JA; Keck PE,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D017418: Meta-Analysis,D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D010054: Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale; D016001: Confidence Intervals; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D016014: Linear Models; D008297: Male; D015990: Placebo Effect; D010919: Placebos; D016032: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; D012559: Schizophrenia; D016896: Treatment Outcome,,,https://openalex.org/W1574289536,107,14,1,1727,251,11

false,efficacy of newer generation antipsychotics in the treatment of schizophrenia,"the advent of the newer 'atypical' antipsychotic medications has revolutionized the pharmacologic treatment of schizophrenia and other psychotic disorders. in contrast to the older conventional antipsychotic agents, atypical medications have a broader spectrum of efficacy (greater efficacy in negative, cognitive, and mood symptoms) and a lower risk of extrapyramidal symptoms (eps) and tardive dyskinesia. due to concerns surrounding hematological safety and other adverse effects, clozapine is used principally in patients refractory to treatment with other antipsychotic agents. the other three universally available atypical agents (risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine) collectively constitute about 70% of all antipsychotic prescriptions in the usa. despite the broad popularity of these medications and their rapid adoption in general clinical practice, there are limited data on how they compare to each other with regards to their overall efficacy and also as to their efficacy in specific symptom domains. to address this question, two separate analyses were undertaken. first, all published, short-term, randomized, controlled clinical trials of these agents in schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder were reviewed and the extent of improvement across these agents was compared. while the amount of improvement with a particular agent across its different studies varied, the average improvement was similar for the agents for all efficacy parameters considered. secondly, all randomized, controlled clinical trials directly comparing two or more of these agents in patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder were analyzed. only three such trials (all industry sponsored) were identified; while there were differences in methodology and small differences in efficacy on a minority of measures on which comparisons were undertaken, the preponderance of data suggested no differences in efficacy. while data thus far do not support assertions of differential efficacy between risperidone, olanzapine, and quetiapine, there are clear differences in their side-effect profiles and these are briefly summarized.",Tandon R,2003,Psychoneuroendocrinology,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0306-4530(02)00110-5,12504069,Tandon R; Jibson MD,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D006801: Humans; D012559: Schizophrenia; D012565: Schizophrenic Psychology,,,https://openalex.org/W2127126926,77,10,1,2138,337,11

false,placebo-controlled trials do not find association of olanzapine with exacerbation of bipolar mania,"published case reports describe apparent induction or exacerbation of manic-like symptoms during treatment with the atypical antipsychotics olanzapine and risperidone. to date, such reports are from uncontrolled clinical experience and therefore cannot clarify whether the atypical antipsychotics caused such manic-like states or simply failed to prevent them. presumably, bipolar patients would be at increased risk for this putative adverse event. therefore, we evaluated the potential of olanzapine to exacerbate symptoms of mania compared to placebo during treatment of bipolar mania.two inpatient, double-blind, randomized trials investigating the efficacy of olanzapine 5-20 mg daily versus placebo for the treatment of acute mania were combined. two hundred and fifty-four subjects participated (placebo n=129; olanzapine n=125) in the two studies. severity of mania was quantified with the 11-item young-mania rating scale (y-mrs). in a post-hoc analysis, after double-blind therapy up to 3 weeks, categorical comparison of olanzapine and placebo groups was made for any worsening and worsening by 10 or 20% from baseline y-mrs scores (locf).the percentage of subjects with exacerbation at endpoint were: any worsening, placebo 37.7%, olanzapine 21.8% (p=0.005); >or=10% worsening, placebo 24.6%, olanzapine 14.5% (p=0.039); >or=20% worsening, placebo 15.6%, olanzapine 8.1% (p=0.064).mania rating scores worsened for some patients during olanzapine therapy. however, this was significantly less common with olanzapine than with placebo. these controlled data suggest that clinical case reports of occurrence of 'mania' during treatment with olanzapine, and possibly those with other atypical antipsychotics, reflect exacerbation in the natural history of bipolar illness, rather than an adverse pharmacological effect.post-hoc analysis of pooled data from two different studies.",Baker RW,2003,J Affect Disord,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0165-0327(02)00335-x,12507747,Baker RW; Milton DR; Stauffer VL; Gelenberg A; Tohen M,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016448: Multicenter Study; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D001714: Bipolar Disorder; D018450: Disease Progression; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine; D010919: Placebos; D012720: Severity of Illness Index; D016896: Treatment Outcome,,,https://openalex.org/W2074870716,98,13,1,1887,314,9

objective: to investigate the efficacy, safety and tolerability of three dosing strategies for switching chronic, stable patients with schizophrenia from current oral antipsychotic monotherapy to once-daily oral aripiprazole monotherapy.
method: patients in this 8-week, open-label, outpatient study were randomized to: 1). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole with simultaneous immediate discontinuation of current antipsychotic; 2). immediate initiation of 30 mg/day aripiprazole while tapering off current antipsychotic over 2 weeks; or 3). up-titrating aripiprazole to 30 mg/day over 2 weeks, while simultaneously tapering off current antipsychotic. efficacy assessments included panss, cgi-s, and cgi-i scores. safety assessments included: adverse events (aes) recording, evaluation of extrapyramidal symptoms (eps), vital signs, ecg, and clinical laboratory tests.
results: efficacy with aripiprazole was maintained during the study with numerical improvements compared with baseline in all three groups. the overall incidence of aes was broadly comparable across all groups, and aes were generally mild to moderate in severity and time-limited. discontinuations due to aes were comparable across the groups. no deterioration in eps occurred in any group. the reduction in body weight and plasma prolactin levels following switch to aripiprazole were comparable across the three groups.
conclusion: any of the three strategies evaluated can be used safely for switching patients to aripiprazole from antipsychotic monotherapy. furthermore, patients' symptoms may continue to improve after switching to aripiprazole.",Casey DE,2003,Psychopharmacology (Berl),https://doi.org/10.1007/s00213-002-1344-3,12610718,Casey DE; Carson WH; Saha AR; Liebeskind A; Ali MW; Jody D; Ingenito GG; Aripiprazole Study Group,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016448: Multicenter Study; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D000068180: Aripiprazole; D004334: Drug Administration Schedule; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D010879: Piperazines; D015363: Quinolones; D012559: Schizophrenia; D016896: Treatment Outcome,,,https://openalex.org/W2067763161,98,13,1,1888,299,16

false,measurement of simple reaction time in antipsychotic treatment of patients with schizophrenia,"background: the role of simple reaction time in schizophrenia has been extensively reported to date in professional literature. however, most studies have examined basic reaction time under static conditions using a single measurement. the aim of the present study was to establish whether any changes occur in simple reaction time during treatment with risperidone or olanzapine in in-patients suffering a relapse of schizophrenia.
methods: seventeen in-patients suffering acute relapse of schizophrenia (dsm iv criteria) and twenty matched, healthy controls participated in an eight-week, double-blind pilot study. the patients were treated with conventional antipsychotics for seven days after admission and were then randomised to the treatment arms with risperidone (4 mg/day) or with olanzapine (10 mg/day) at a fixed dosage in the first week and thereafter in flexible dosages for the remaining seven weeks. since no differences were found between reaction times of patients treated with risperidone or olanzapine, the two treatment groups were merged in the statistical analysis before being compared with the normal controls. psychopathological symptoms were assessed using the positive and negative symptom scale (panss) and extrapyramidal symptoms with the simpson angus scale and abnormal involuntary movement scale. reaction time was measured with the alpha apparatus, connected to a personal computer. all assessments and measurements were conducted four times during the treatment phase of the study.
results: the reaction time of patients was significantly longer than that of the healthy controls (t1 = 17.11; p1 < 0.05). after eight weeks of treatment the reaction time of patients significantly improved but did not reach that of the healthy controls (t4 = 28.18, p4 < 0.05). furthermore, the improved reaction time in the patients did not correlate with improvement of psychopathological symptoms or with improved extrapyramidal symptoms.

bipolar disorder is a common, severe psychiatric disorder that is characterised by recurrent manic, mixed, and depressive episodes. cognitive, behavioural, and psychotic symptoms often occur during mood episodes, and suicide rates in bipolar disorder are among the highest of all psychiatric illnesses.1 acute bipolar manic and mixed episodes often constitute medical emergencies, requiring admission to hospital to ensure safety and rapid recovery. however, morbidity from mania is not limited to acute episodes as full recovery of functioning often lags months behind remission of symptoms.2 medications form the cornerstone of treatment of mania, and in the past decade randomised controlled trials of new medications for this syndrome have proliferated. these studies have addressed important questions about the short term efficacy and tolerability of new agents, alone and in combination.

false,clozapine therapy for parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders,"recent research on the role of clozapine in the treatment of parkinson’s disease and other movement disorders is discussed. most clinical trials have shown resolution of or improvement in psychotic symptoms accompanying parkinson’s disease without worsening of parkinsonian symptoms. adverse effects appear to be mild at dosages of < 100 mg/day; sedation is the most frequent problem. most of these studies have serious limitations, however; until better studies have been completed, the decision to use clozapine for parkinson’s disease-related psychosis should be made on a case-by-case basis, with thorough evaluation of risks, benefits, and other therapeutic options. some patients with parkinson’s disease have shown improvement in tremor and other abnormal movements when given clozapine. clozapine cannot be recommended for treating tardive dyskinesia on the basis of the research done so far; some trials show dramatic resolution of symptoms, others no benefit. anticholinergics or dopamine-reuptake inhibitors should be considered before clozapine is given to patients with tardive dyskinesia because of clozapine’s potential for serious adverse effects. a few patients with huntington’s disease have responded to clozapine, but again no conclusions can be drawn. clozapine appears to offer no real advantage over haloperidol for treating choreiform movements in huntington’s disease. the frequency of tics in tourette’s syndrome does not seem to be reduced by clozapine. clozapine has shown some efficacy as a treatment for psychosis and abnormal movements in parkinson’s disease. results have been less promising for other movement disorders. further study in larger populations is needed before any definitive conclusions about clozapine’s place in movement disorder therapy can be made.",Pfeiffer C,1994,Am J Hosp Pharm,https://doi.org/10.1093/ajhp/51.24.3047,7856623,Pfeiffer C; Wagner ML,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D003024: Clozapine; D004409: Dyskinesia, Drug-Induced; D006801: Humans; D006816: Huntington Disease; D009069: Movement Disorders; D019965: Neurocognitive Disorders; D010300: Parkinson Disease; D005879: Tourette Syndrome",,,https://openalex.org/W2283117062,70,11,1,1799,303,13

false,a pharmacokinetic interaction between carbamazepine and olanzapine: observations on possible mechanism,"objective: olanzapine is a novel antipsychotic, which is effective against both the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia and causes fewer extrapyramidal adverse effects than conventional antipsychotics. the purpose of the present study was to assess the potential for a pharmacokinetic interaction between olanzapine and carbamazepine, since these agents are likely to be used concomitantly in the treatment of manic psychotic disorder.
method: the pharmacokinetics of two single therapeutic doses of olanzapine were determined in 11 healthy volunteers. the first dose of olanzapine (10 mg) was taken alone and the second dose (10 mg) after 2 weeks of treatment with carbamazepine (200 mg bid). measurement of urinary 6beta-hydroxycortisol/cortisol excretion was used as an endogenous marker to confirm that induction of cyp3a4 by carbamazepine had occurred.
results: the dose of olanzapine given after a 2-week pretreatment with carbamazepine was cleared more rapidly than olanzapine given alone. olanzapine pharmacokinetic values for cmax and auc were significantly lower after the second dose, the elimination half-life was significantly shorter, and the clearance and volume of distribution were significantly increased.
conclusion: carbamazepine has been shown to induce several p450 cytochromes including cyp3a4 and cyp1a2. since cyp1a2 plays a role in the metabolic clearance of olanzapine, the interaction may be attributed to induction of cyp1a2 by carbamazepine, leading to increased first-pass and systemic metabolism of olanzapine. the interaction is not considered to be of clinical significance because olanzapine has a wide therapeutic index, and the changes in plasma concentration of olanzapine are within the fourfold variation that occurs without concern for safety in a patient population.",Lucas RA,1998,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s002280050527,9860152,Lucas RA; Gilfillan DJ; Bergstrom RF,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D018848: Controlled Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article,"D000284: Administration, Oral; D000293: Adolescent; D000328: Adult; D014150: Antipsychotic Agents; D001569: Benzodiazepines; D015415: Biomarkers; D002220: Carbamazepine; D051544: Cytochrome P-450 CYP3A; D003577: Cytochrome P-450 Enzyme System; D004347: Drug Interactions; D006801: Humans; D006854: Hydrocortisone; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D006899: Mixed Function Oxygenases; D000077152: Olanzapine; D010890: Pirenzepine",,,https://openalex.org/W2073975093,102,12,1,1823,287,10
