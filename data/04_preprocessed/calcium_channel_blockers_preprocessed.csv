false,preterm labor.,"preterm labor is the leading cause of perinatal morbidity and mortality in the united states. it is characterized by cervical effacement and/or dilatation and increased uterine irritability before 37 weeks of gestation. women with a history of preterm labor are at greatest risk. strategies for reducing the incidence of preterm labor and delivery have focused on educating both physicians and patients about the risks for preterm labor and methods of detecting preterm cervical dilatation. methods used to predict preterm labor include weekly cervical assessment, transvaginal ultrasonography, detection of fetal fibronectin and home uterine activity monitoring. as yet, it is unclear if any of these strategies should be routinely employed. at present, management of preterm labor may include the use of tocolytic agents, corticosteroids and antibiotics.",Weismiller DG,1999,Am Fam Physician,,10029786,Weismiller DG,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454: Review","D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007752: Obstetric Labor, Premature; D011247: Pregnancy; D012306: Risk; D012307: Risk Factors; D015149: Tocolytic Agents; D016216: Ultrasonography, Prenatal",,,https://openalex.org/W4299600072,14,3,1,856,137,7
false,efficacy of preconditioning with intracoronary diltiazem in preventing laser-induced spasm.,"laser energy produces a multitude of effects, resulting both in therapeutic tissue ablation and complications such as laser-induced spasm (lis). lis can occur during lasing itself or during subsequent adjunctive angioplasty. intracoronary diltiazem (icd) can partially reverse lis after it occurs. to determine whether pre-treatment with icd might prevent lis during laser interventions, 3 groups of 50 lesions each were studied. group 1 served as controls receiving no icd during the procedure. group 2 received 2.5 mg icd before lasing. group 3 received icd before lasing and then a second infusion of 2.5 mg icd after lasing but before adjunctive therapy. there were no differences in clinical characteristics of the 3 groups. over 75% of lesions in each group were complex (b2 or c) lesions, and average lesion length was 15 mm in all 3 groups. procedural success was > or = 94% in all groups. there was no significant difference among groups in pre-procedure artery stenosis, post-procedure stenosis, laser power used or number of laser pulses delivered. pretreatment with icd produced vasodilation of the minimum lumen diameter from 0.86 +/- 0.1 to 1.0 +/- 0.1 mm (p < 0.01) and was well tolerated. control patients exhibited a 12% incidence of lis. group 2 had an 80% reduction of lis during lasing (p < 0.01) but had increased lis during adjunctive therapy with the same 12% incidence of lis overall. group 3 had only a 2% incidence of lis (p < 0.01). we concluded that pretreatment with icd significantly reduces lis. multiple infusions of icd are necessary to sustain this protective effect.",McIvor M,1995,J Invasive Cardiol,,10158113,McIvor M; Undemir C; Moses J; Reddinger J; Lawson J,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D015906: Angioplasty, Balloon, Coronary; D017222: Angioplasty, Balloon, Laser-Assisted; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D003329: Coronary Vasospasm; D004110: Diltiazem; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004334: Drug Administration Schedule; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007261: Infusions, Intra-Arterial; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D011292: Premedication; D011859: Radiography; D016896: Treatment Outcome",,,https://openalex.org/W2406071529,91,11,1,1601,302,17

false,[treatment of renal hypertension].,"in recent years in conjunction with medicamentous treatment of renoparenchymatous hypertension in particular two problems were discussed: target blood pressure values and renoprotective effects of antihypertensive drugs. prospective studies revealed that a blood pressure reading of < 130/80 mm hg significantly retards the progression of nephropathy whereby patients with proteinuria > 1 g/d benefit from even lower bp readings. in diabetic nephropathy the drugs of choice are inhibitors of angiotensin converting enzyme (acei), already in the incipient stage and also in normotensive patients. the importance of acei in the treatment of non-diabetic nephropathies was confirmed recently by controlled prospective studies aipri and rein. a maximal renoprotective effect of acei probably calls for larger doses than those needed for normalization of bp. long-term investigations of the renoprotective effect of antagonists of angiotensin at1 receptors and comparative studies with acei resp. are not available. dihydropyridine blockers of calcium channels with a short-term action (nifedipine) may have a negative influence on the progression of diabetic nephropathy, the effect of dihydropyridines of the second generation is tested in prospective studies. non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers have a renoprotective action in diabetic nephropathy. in cca two thirds of the patients combined treatment with acei and diuretics or with calcium channel blockers is necessary. as to other antihypertensive drugs, vasodilatating beta-blockers and perspectively antagonists of endothelin receptors are useful.",Oksa A,2000,Vnitr Lek,,11227186,Oksa A; Spustová V; Dzúrik R,article,D004740: English Abstract; D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D001794: Blood Pressure; D006801: Humans; D006977: Hypertension, Renal",,,https://openalex.org/W2415091903,34,7,1,1611,241,11
false,long term effect of nifedipine gits and lisinopril on subclinical organ damage in patients with essential hypertension.,"background: preventing subclinical organ damage is currently a major issue in the management of patients with essential hypertension. antihypertensive drugs which act through different pathophysiological mechanisms might confer specific target organ protection beyond what is already provided by their blood pressure lowering effect.
methods: thirty-one patients with essential hypertension were randomized to receive long-term treatment with either a calcium channel blocker (nifedipine gits, 90 mg/day) or an ace-inhibitor (lisinopril, 20 mg/day). blood pressure, left ventricular mass, carotid wall thickness and timed urinary albumin excretion were measured at baseline and over the course of 24 months of treatment.
results: both regimens significantly lowered mean blood pressure over the 24 months (from 124+/-2 to 103+/-2 mmhg in the lisinopril group and from 122+/-2 to 104+/-1 in the nifedipine group). overall, end-organ damage improved with persistent blood pressure control. however, the two treatments had different specific effects. lisinopril induced a more pronounced reduction of the left ventricular mass index (from 56+/-3 to 52+/-2 g/m2.7, p< 0.05) and urinary albumin excretion (from 34+/-15 to 9+/-2 microg/min, p< 0.01), while nifedipine achieved a greater reduction of carotid intima plus media thickness (from 0.8+/-0.06 to 0.6+/-0.06 mm, p< 0.01).
conclusions: blood pressure control does help reduce the severity of organ damage in patients with essential hypertension. different antihypertensive treatments may confer additional specific cardiorenal and vascular protection regardless of blood pressure control. these data could be useful when devising individualized therapeutic strategies in high-risk hypertensive patients.",Pontremoli R,2001,J Nephrol,,11281339,Pontremoli R; Viazzi F; Ravera M; Leoncini G; Berruti V; Bezante GP; Del Sette M; Deferrari G,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,D000806: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D017706: Lisinopril; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009543: Nifedipine; D013997: Time Factors,,,https://openalex.org/W194883094,119,18,1,1758,280,11

false,levosimendan: a new dual‐action drug in the treatment of acute heart failure,"levosimendan is a new agent for the treatment of acute heart failure. levosimendan acts via complementary mechanisms; it enhances contractility by sensitising cardiac myofilaments to calcium and dilates blood vessels by opening atp-dependent potassium channels. in contrast to traditional inotropes (beta-agonists or phosphodiesterase inhibitors), levosimendan does not raise myocyte calcium levels and is therefore less likely to elicit arrhythmias or to impair diastolic relaxation. the clinical efficacy of levosimendan is supported by four key clinical studies, including more than 900 patients hospitalised for cardiac decompensation due to acutely worsened chronic heart failure or to heart failure following myocardial infarction. when given as short-term therapy, levosimendan enhances cardiac output, reduces systemic vascular resistance and lowers pulmonary capillary wedge pressure. at 31 days post-treatment, mortality rates were halved in decompensated chronic heart failure patients who received levosimendan, compared with those on dobutamine--an advantage sustained at 180 days. similar survival gains were observed among acute failure patients treated with levosimendan following myocardial infarction. with its substantial haemodynamic and survival benefits, levosimendan is well suited to be part of routine management for patients with acutely decompensated heart failure.",Mebazaa A,2003,Int J Clin Pract,,12846347,Mebazaa A; Erhardt L,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000208: Acute Disease; D002316: Cardiotonic Agents; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D006333: Heart Failure; D006801: Humans; D006835: Hydrazones; D011724: Pyridazines; D016032: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; D000077464: Simendan; D016019: Survival Analysis; D016896: Treatment Outcome",,,https://openalex.org/W1801814366,76,13,1,1392,204,8

false,pulmonary arterial hypertension--the primary pulmonary hypertension syndromes.,"there is a broad range of diseases that can cause an elevation in pulmonary pressures. pulmonary hypertension is the focal point and cause of significant morbidity and mortality in some of these disorders but plays a secondary, less clinically central role in others. pulmonary arterial hypertension is a subclass of pulmonary hypertension that includes the former type of disorders in which progressive elevation in pulmonary pressures and right heart failure are often the cause of death. the classic example of this group is primary pulmonary hypertension. this review will focus on the various forms of pulmonary arterial hypertension, their pathophysiology, and recent advances in treatment of this life-threatening disorder. pulmonary hypertension is a hemodynamic abnormality with multiple causes and clinical presentations. the world health organization classification of ph is detailed in table 1 [1]. this system breaks the classification of ph into five major categories: a) pulmonary arterial hypertension, b) pulmonary venous hypertension, c) ph associated with disorders of the respiratory system and/ or hypoxemia, d) embolic disorders, and e) disorders directly affecting the vasculature. it is important to distinguish the various diseases included under the who classification because the various forms of ph are quite separate in their natural history and treatment. for example, treatment of ph related to congestive heart failure with pulmonary venous hypertension is aimed at improving the primary abnormalities of left ventricular dysfunction and volume overload rather than attempting to dilate pulmonary vessels. ph due to primary respiratory disease such as emphysema is not treated by vasodilators other than oxygen. these examples are in contrast to the treatment of pah in which lowering pulmonary vascular resistance is a primary and effective treatment. the current review will focus on the first group in the who classification.",Hey JC,2003,Isr Med Assoc J,,14509142,Hey JC; Scharf SM,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D000077300: Bosentan; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D016232: Endothelins; D011464: Epoprostenol; D006801: Humans; D006976: Hypertension, Pulmonary; D013449: Sulfonamides; D014665: Vasodilator Agents",,,https://openalex.org/W2422069474,78,10,1,1960,319,13

### summary points

antihypertensive treatment is well tolerated in pregnancy, with few women needing to change drugs due to side effects

antihypertensive treatment for mild chronic hypertension benefits the mother, but the impact on perinatal outcomes is less clear, particularly for atenolol

for hypertension presenting later in pregnancy, even near term, the available data do not allow for reliable conclusions to be made about the benefits and risks of restricted activity with or without admission to hospital

antihypertensive treatment for mild to moderate hypertension later in pregnancy benefits the mother, but the impact on perinatal outcomes may be harmful or beneficial

women with early, severe pre-eclampsia have better perinatal outcomes if they are managed “expectantly,” but data are insufficient to estimate risks to the mother

for acute severe hypertension later in pregnancy, parenteral hydralazine is not the drug of choice as it is associated with more maternal and perinatal adverse effects than are other drugs, particularly intravenous labetalol or oral or sublingual nifedipine

antihypertensive treatment given antenatally should probably be reordered postnatally

diabetes and hypertension are among the commonest diseases in developed countries, and the frequency of both diseases rises with age. in the wisconsin study examining patients with type 1 diabetes, hypertension was defined by current antihypertensive treatment or a mean blood pressure ⩾160/95 (or ⩾140/90 in those under 25 years). the prevalence of hypertension at baseline was 17.3%, and the 10 year incidence was 25.9%.5 hypertension is more common in type 2 diabetes, and in the ukpds 38% of newly diagnosed patients with type 2 diabetes had hypertension defined as repeated blood pressure ⩾160/90 (or ⩾150/85 in those on antihypertensive medication).6 in the years after diagnosis of type 2 diabetes the incidence of hypertension is higher than in the age matched general population.

in type 1 diabetes the development of diabetic nephropathy may play a major role in the subsequent development of hypertension since microalbuminuria is present in about 80% of type 1 diabetic subjects before the onset of hypertension.7 the pathogenesis of hypertension …",Gillow JT,1999,Br J Ophthalmol,https://doi.org/10.1136/bjo.83.9.1083,10460781,Gillow JT; Gibson JM; Dodson PM,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D003930: Diabetic Retinopathy; D018450: Disease Progression; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D011364: Professional Practice,,,https://openalex.org/W2154741382,57,10,1,1944,322,7

false,effect of amlodipine on exercise‐induced platelet activation in patients affected by chronic stable angina,"abstract background: literature concerning exercise‐induced platelet activation in chronic stable angina is somewhat confusing. the reason lies in the type of exercise as well as in methodological problems. a powerful, recently introduced procedure to detect platelet activation is flow cytometry. platelet response to activating factors is mediated by calcium uptake; however, calcium antagonist effect on platelet activity is still unclear. hypothesis: the study was undertaken to investigate exercise‐induced platelet activation before and after treatment with amlodipine in chronic stable angina. methods: twenty patients with chronic stable angina were entered into the study. each subject underwent a symptom‐limited cycloergometer stress test following a washout period of 2 weeks. blood samples were collected before and immediately after exercise. all subjects were then randomized into two groups of 10 patients each, with group 1 and group 2 taking amlodipine 10 mg/day, and placebo for 4 weeks, respectively. they subsequently underwent a second exercise stress test, and blood samples were obtained before and immediately after exercise. flow‐cytometric evaluation of platelet activity was performed in order to recognize gmp‐140 expression on platelet membrane. results: strenuous exercise induced a significant increase in platelet activation in all subjects prior to therapy. no significant differences were observed in platelet activity at rest between groups 1 and 2, whereas a significant decrease in exercise‐induced platelet activation was demonstrated in group 1 compared with group 2. conclusion: our data provide evidence of the favorable effect of amlodipine on exercise‐induced platelet activation in patients affected by chronic stable angina.",Sanguigni V,1999,Clin Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1002/clc.4960220907,10486696,Sanguigni V; Gallù M; Sciarra L; Del Principe D; Menichelli A; Palumbo G; Cannata D; Strano A,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000368: Aged; D017311: Amlodipine; D000787: Angina Pectoris; D002118: Calcium; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D015444: Exercise; D005080: Exercise Test; D005260: Female; D005434: Flow Cytometry; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D015539: Platelet Activation; D018709: Statistics, Nonparametric",,,https://openalex.org/W2055621826,106,14,1,1770,275,14

methods: sixty hypertensive patients (asa ii), defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmhg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmhg (who), undergoing elective orthopedic surgery received, in a randomized, double-blind manner, 0.2 mg x kg(-1) diltiazem, 1.0 mg x kg(-1) lidocaine, or 0.2 mg x kg(-1) diltiazem plus 1.0 mg x kg(-1) lidocaine (n=20 of each) i.v. before tracheal extubation. changes in heart rate (hr), mean arterial pressure (map) and rate-pressure product (rpp) were measured before and after tracheal extubation.
results: hemodynamic changes during tracheal extubation were less in patients receiving diltiazem plus lidocaine than in those receiving diltiazem or lidocaine as a sole medicine (rpp; 10322 +/- 1674 (combined) vs 11532 +/- 1802 (diltiazem), 15388 +/- 2050 (lidocaine), mean +/- sd, p < 0.05).

design: prospective clinical study.
setting: one university hospital obstetric unit.
patients: twenty consecutive adult pre-eclamptic patients with severe hypertension.
intervention: nicardipine, 1 microgram/kg per min, was given intravenously to lower the mean arterial pressure (map) by at least 15%. then, the dosage was reduced by 1/3, and the final dosage was determined to maintain map at 20-30% below the initial value, by increasing or decreasing the infusion rate by 0.5 mg/h.
measurements and results: maternal map and heart rate (hr) were assessed every 5 min for 1 h. foetal hr (fhr) was recorded throughout the study period and assessed for fischer score. gestational age, apgar scores, birth weight, capillary filling time and the duration of stay in the paediatric intensive care unit (icu) were used to evaluate the short-term perinatal outcome. a 15-30% decrease in map occurred within 15-20 min in all patients. an increase in hr was noted, and two patients had severe tachycardia. maternal side effects included flushing, headache, nausea and dizziness. fhr showed a transient decrease in acceleration episodes and occurrence of decelerations. no nicardipine-related foetal distress occurred. four infants born during the study period did well at birth and had a good outcome.

false,effect of indomethacin on blood pressure in elderly people with essential hypertension well controlled on amlodipine or enalapril,"arthritis and hypertension are frequent comorbidities in the elderly hypertensive population. nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are often used to relieve pain in arthritic patients but a side effect is sodium retention and consequent elevation of blood pressure (bp). the effect of dihydropyridine calcium blocking drugs is relatively independent of sodium intake, whereas the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors' effects can be blunted by a high-sodium diet. this study compared the effects of indomethacin with placebo in elderly patients with essential hypertension who had been controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. indomethacin 50 mg twice daily or placebo was administered for 3 weeks in a double-blind crossover study to patients controlled with amlodipine or enalapril. the response was assessed by ambulatory bp measurement. indomethacin raised bp and lowered pulse rates in patients taking enalapril but had little effect in patients receiving amlodipine. the difference caused by indomethacin between the two groups was 10.1/4.9 mm hg increase in bp and a 5.6 beats/min fall in pulse in people taking enalapril. addition of indomethacin to patients taking either drug caused a rise in weight and a fall in plasma renin. it is postulated that the effect is due to inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis, which causes sodium retention. in patients taking amlodipine, the fall in plasma renin ameliorates the effect of sodium retention on bp. in patients taking enalapril, plasma renin falls but this is not translated into an effect because of the blockage of converting enzyme. thus, the full effect of sodium retention on bp is expressed. in patients treated with indomethacin, fewer patients may respond to ace inhibitors. however, the major problem is the patient who intermittently takes indomethacin or other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, which, if a person is treated by an ace inhibitor causes bp to go out of control. in such patients amlodipine would appear to be a preferred choice to enalapril.",Morgan TO,2000,Am J Hypertens,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0895-7061(00)01204-8,11078175,Morgan TO; Anderson A; Bertram D,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D015746: Abdominal Pain; D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000369: Aged, 80 and over; D017311: Amlodipine; D000894: Anti-Inflammatory Agents, Non-Steroidal; D001794: Blood Pressure; D001835: Body Weight; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D004347: Drug Interactions; D004415: Dyspepsia; D004656: Enalapril; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D007213: Indomethacin; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009325: Nausea; D010146: Pain; D012083: Renin",,,https://openalex.org/W2082572643,129,18,1,2039,339,16
false,comparison of efficacy and side effects of combination therapy of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (benazepril) with calcium antagonist (either nifedipine or amlodipine) versus high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy for systemic hypertension,"the present 2 multicenter studies were designed to evaluate whether patients with essential hypertension derived equal benefits from use of combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitor as from doubling the dose of the calcium antagonist. after a 2-week washout and a 2-week single-blind placebo run-in period, a total of 1,390 patients were treated with either nifedipine 30 mg (study 1) or amlodipine 5 mg (study 2) once daily for 4 weeks. the 1,079 patients whose diastolic blood pressure remained between 95 and 115 mm hg were randomized to 8 weeks of double-blind therapy with amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, nifedipine 30 mg or nifedipine 60 mg (study 1), and amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 10 mg, amlodipine 5 mg/benazepril 20 mg, amlodipine 5 mg or amlodipine 10 mg (study 2). both doses of the calcium antagonist/ace inhibitor combination therapy lowered diastolic pressure as much as the high dose and significantly better than the lower dose of calcium antagonist monotherapy (with either nifedipine or amlodipine). however, 15% of patients in the nifedipine high-dose monotherapy group and 24% in the amlodipine high-dose monotherapy group presented with some form of edema. in contrast, the incidence of edema was similar for patients treated with both combination therapy and low-dose calcium antagonists. thus, combination therapy with a calcium antagonist and an ace inhibitor provides blood pressure control equal to that of high-dose calcium antagonist monotherapy but with significantly fewer dose-dependent adverse experiences such as vasodilatory edema.",Messerli FH,2000,Am J Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0002-9149(00)01199-1,11090788,Messerli FH; Oparil S; Feng Z,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016448: Multicenter Study; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000293: Adolescent; D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000369: Aged, 80 and over; D017311: Amlodipine; D000806: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; D001552: Benzazepines; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D004359: Drug Therapy, Combination; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009543: Nifedipine; D016037: Single-Blind Method",,,https://openalex.org/W2016342558,250,33,1,1656,279,7

false,effects of a slow-release nifedipine on 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure and ischemic changes on 24-hour ambulatory electrocardiogram in patients with severe coronary artery disease,"calcium antagonists have long been used as first-line drugs for hypertension and angina. however, deleterious effects have also been reported in patients treated with calcium antagonists. thus, we evaluated the effect of a slow-release twice-daily formulation of nifedipine in 10 patients with severe coronary artery disease. twenty-four-hour ambulatory electrocardiography (aecg) and blood pressure monitoring (abpm) were performed simultaneously to detect any association between ischemic episodes on the ecg and changes in blood pressure (bp) and heart rate with and without nifedipine. increased oxygen demand due to an increased systolic bp and heart rate was associated with ischemic episodes without nifedipine, while those with nifedipine were accompanied by a fall in diastolic bp and a rapid increase in heart rate. this slow-release twice-daily formulation of nifedipine may induce myocardial ischemia through a heart-rate increase and a decrease in coronary blood flow due to lower diastolic bp in patients with severe coronary artery disease. a once-daily formulation of nifedipine might be of great value for such patients.",Matsumoto N,2000,Cardiology,https://doi.org/10.1159/000007044,11111143,Matsumoto N; Ideishi M; Sasaguri M; Nii T; Nakashima Y; Arakawa K,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D018848: Controlled Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article,"D000368: Aged; D000369: Aged, 80 and over; D000704: Analysis of Variance; D018660: Blood Pressure Monitoring, Ambulatory; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D003327: Coronary Disease; D003692: Delayed-Action Preparations; D015716: Electrocardiography, Ambulatory; D005260: Female; D006339: Heart Rate; D006439: Hemodynamics; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D017202: Myocardial Ischemia; D009543: Nifedipine; D011336: Probability; D012016: Reference Values; D018570: Risk Assessment; D012720: Severity of Illness Index",,,https://openalex.org/W2081271935,182,24,1,1137,181,7
false,vatanidipine hydrochloride: a new long-lasting antihypertensive agent,"vatanidipine is a novel dihydropyridine (dhp)-type calcium channel blocker with slow-onset pharmacological actions, which are probably due to both its slow uptake into vascular tissues and resistance in its approach to the calcium channel binding site. vatanidipine once incorporated into vascular tissues is not easily released, even by repeated washing, thus resulting in a long-lasting action of the agent. a slow-onset and long-lasting hypotensive action was observed in various experimental hypertensive models. clinical trials using human subjects with essential hypertension indicated that vatanidipine exerts an antihypertensive effect with a slow onset and long duration. in spite of its potent hypotensive effect, the incidence of adverse effects by vatanidipine administration has been reported to be lower than that in cases of nitrendipine. in addition to its vasodilatory effects, vatanidipine efficiently suppressed noradrenaline release from sympathetic nerve endings, thus suggesting this agent exhibits a beneficial effect in the treatment of hypertensive patients, in which the reflex activation of peripheral sympathetic nerves is unfavourable to antihypertensive therapy. in a double-blind study, vatanidipine did not show reflex tachycardia, despite producing a potent and long-lasting hypotensive effect, in contrast to the administration of nitrendipine. in an animal study, vatanidipine exhibited a protective effect against cerebrovascular lesions, through a mechanism independent of its hypotensive effect. in addition, a renoprotective effect was also observed in experimental hypertensive models. in cholesterol-fed rabbits, vatanidipine exerted an anti-atherosclerotic action, which is probably attributable to the inhibitory action of the agent on low-density lipoprotein oxidation. in essential hypertensive patients, the plasma levels of cholesterol and triglyceride decreased after vatanidipine treatment, thus suggesting that this agent may have a therapeutic potential in preventing such vascular diseases as atherosclerosis. taken together, vatanidipine appears to be a novel and useful antihypertensive agent, which can both prevent target-organ damage and reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality.",Matsumura Y,2001,Expert Opin Investig Drugs,https://doi.org/10.1517/13543784.10.1.139,11116287,Matsumura Y; Hayashi K,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,D000818: Animals; D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D001161: Arteriosclerosis; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D004095: Dihydropyridines; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D009568: Nitrendipine,,,https://openalex.org/W2100224348,69,8,1,2241,334,12

true,rhythm or rate control in atrial fibrillation—pharmacological intervention in atrial fibrillation (piaf): a randomised trial,"atrial fibrillation is the most commonly encountered sustained cardiac arrhythmia. restoration and maintenance of sinus rhythm is believed by many physicians to be superior to rate control only. however, there are no prospective data that compare both therapeutic strategies.the pharmacological intervention in atrial fibrillation (piaf) trial was a randomised trial in 252 patients with atrial fibrillation of between 7 days and 360 days duration, which compared rate (group a, 125 patients) with rhythm control (group b, 127 patients). in group a, diltiazem was used as first-line therapy and amiodarone was used in group b. the primary study endpoint was improvement in symptoms related to atrial fibrillation.over the entire observation period of 1 year, a similar proportion of patients reported improvement in symptoms in both groups (76 responders at 12 months in group a vs 70 responders in group b, p=0.317). amiodarone administration resulted in pharmacological restoration of sinus rhythm in 23% of patients. walking distance in a 6 min walk test was better in group b compared with group a, but assessment of quality of life showed no differences between groups. the incidence of hospital admission was higher in group b (87 [69%] out of 127 vs 30 [24%] out of 125 in group a, p=0.001). adverse drug effects more frequently led to a change in therapy in group b (31 [25%] patients compared with 17 [14%] in group a, p=0.036).with respect to symptomatic improvement in patients with atrial fibrillation, the therapeutic strategies of rate versus rhythm control yielded similar clinical results overall. however, exercise tolerance is better with rhythm control, although hospital admission is more frequent. these data may serve as a basis to select therapy in individual patients.",Hohnloser SH,2000,Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(00)03230-x,11117910,Hohnloser SH; Kuck KH; Lilienthal J,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016448: Multicenter Study; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000638: Amiodarone; D000889: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; D001281: Atrial Fibrillation; D004110: Diltiazem; D004554: Electric Countershock; D005500: Follow-Up Studies; D006339: Heart Rate; D006760: Hospitalization; D006801: Humans; D008875: Middle Aged; D005082: Physical Exertion; D011788: Quality of Life,,,https://openalex.org/W2124805101,124,18,1,1792,330,11
true,health outcomes associated with calcium antagonists compared with other first-line antihypertensive therapies: a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials,"several observational studies and individual randomised trials in hypertension have suggested that, compared with other drugs, calcium antagonists may be associated with a higher risk of coronary events, despite similar blood-pressure control. the aim of this meta-analysis was to compare the effects of calcium antagonists and other antihypertensive drugs on major cardiovascular events.we undertook a meta-analysis of trials in hypertension that assessed cardiovascular events and included at least 100 patients, who were randomly assigned intermediate-acting or long-acting calcium antagonists or other antihypertensive drugs and who were followed up for at least 2 years.the nine eligible trials included 27,743 participants. calcium antagonists and other drugs achieved similar control of both systolic and diastolic blood pressure. compared with patients assigned diuretics, beta-blockers, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, or clonidine (n=15,044), those assigned calcium antagonists (n=12,699) had a significantly higher risk of acute myocardial infarction (odds ratio 1.26 [95% ci 1.11-1.43], p=0.0003), congestive heart failure (1.25 [1.07-1.46], p=0.005), and major cardiovascular events (1.10 [1.02-1.18], p=0.018). the treatment differences were within the play of chance for the outcomes of stroke (0.90 [0.80-1.02], p=0.10) and all-cause mortality (1.03 [0.94-1.13], p=0.54).in randomised controlled trials, the large available database suggests that calcium antagonists are inferior to other types of antihypertensive drugs as first-line agents in reducing the risks of several major complications of hypertension. on the basis of these data, the longer-acting calcium antagonists cannot be recommended as first-line therapy for hypertension.",Pahor M,2000,Lancet,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0140-6736(00)03306-7,11130522,Pahor M; Psaty BM; Alderman MH; Applegate WB; Williamson JD; Cavazzini C; Furberg CD,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D017418: Meta-Analysis,D000368: Aged; D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D003327: Coronary Disease; D003971: Diastole; D005260: Female; D006333: Heart Failure; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009203: Myocardial Infarction; D016032: Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; D020521: Stroke; D013599: Systole; D016896: Treatment Outcome,,,https://openalex.org/W2116620721,158,19,1,1765,282,6

false,clinical features and natural history of nonalcoholic steatosis syndromes,"nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, along with other forms of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, is a chronic liver disease that is attracting increasing significance. it is a clinicopathologic syndrome that was originally described in obese, diabetic females who denied alcohol use but in whom the hepatic histology was consistent with alcoholic hepatitis. this typical patient profile has been expanded and is now recognized to occur even in normal weight males without overt abnormalities in carbohydrate metabolism. although originally believed to be a benign clinical entity, nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is now recognized as a cause of progressive fibrotic liver disease with adverse clinical sequelae. it is important to emphasize that nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is best considered one type of a larger spectrum of nonalcoholic fatty liver disease that is a consequence of insulin resistance and ranges from fat alone to fat plus inflammation, fat plus ballooning degeneration, and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis, the latter being the most serious form. as with any disease, the clinical importance of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is related to its prevalence and natural history. recent studies using different methodologies indicate that in the general population the prevalence of fatty liver and nonalcoholic steatohepatitis is approximately 20% and 3%, respectively. these prevalence rates are increased in certain subpopulations such as obesity and type ii diabetes. of greater concern is the recognition that cirrhosis and liver-related deaths occur in approximately 20% and 8% of these patients, respectively, over a 10-year period. risk factors for these adverse clinical symptoms include patients older than the age of 45, the presence of diabetes or obesity, an aspartate aminotransferase/alanine aminotransferase ratio >1 and hepatic histology. however, a number of important unresolved issues must be clarified before the true natural history of this disease can be fully understood.",Falck-Ytter Y,2001,Semin Liver Dis,https://doi.org/10.1055/s-2001-12926,11296693,Falck-Ytter Y; Younossi ZM; Marchesini G; McCullough AJ,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D002908: Chronic Disease; D003937: Diagnosis, Differential; D018450: Disease Progression; D005234: Fatty Liver; D006801: Humans; D012307: Risk Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2040538211,73,9,1,1996,316,11

false,increased dispersion and shortened refractoriness caused by verapamil in chronic atrial fibrillation,"the objective was to assess the effect ofverapamil on atrial fibrillation (af) cycle length and spatial dispersion of refractoriness in patients with chronic af.previous studies have suggested that verapamil prevents acute remodeling by af. the effects of verapamil in chronic af are unknown.during electrophysiologic study in 15 patients with chronic af (duration >1 year), 12 unipolar electrograms were recorded from right atrial free wall, right atrial appendage and coronary sinus, along with monophasic action potential recordings from the right atrial appendage. the mean fibrillatory interval at each atrial recording site was used as an index for local refractoriness. dispersion of refractoriness was calculated as the standard deviation of all local mean fibrillatory intervals expressed as a percentage of the overall mean fibrillatory interval. after baseline measurements, verapamil (0.075 mg/kg intravenous in 10 min) was infused and the measurements were repeated.after administration ofverapamil, mean fibrillatory intervals shortened by a mean of 16.6 +/- 3.3 ms (p < 0.001) at the right free wall, 15.0 +/- 3.5 ms (p < 0.001) at the appendage and 17.1 +/- 3.2 ms (p < 0.01) in the coronary sinus. monophasic action potential duration decreased by 15.9 +/- 4.0 ms (p < 0.01). dispersion of refractoriness increased in all patients from 3.8 +/- 0.8 to 5.1 +/- 1.8 (p < 0.001). a strong correlation between mean fibrillatory intervals and action potential duration was found, both before and after verapamil.verapamil caused shortening of refractoriness and increase in spatial dispersion of refractoriness in patients with chronic af. this implies that verapamil is not useful in reversing the remodeling process in these patients.",Ramanna H,2001,J Am Coll Cardiol,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0735-1097(01)01132-9,11300453,Ramanna H; Elvan A; Wittkampf FH; de Bakker JM; Hauer RN; Robles de Medina EO,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000368: Aged; D001281: Atrial Fibrillation; D002908: Chronic Disease; D004562: Electrocardiography; D005260: Female; D006325: Heart Atria; D006801: Humans; D007262: Infusions, Intravenous; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D017211: Treatment Failure; D014700: Verapamil",,,https://openalex.org/W1982263626,100,12,1,1747,297,9
true,effects of pretreatment with verapamil on early recurrences after electrical cardioversion of persistent atrial fibrillation: a randomised study,"atrial fibrillation (af) is a very common arrhythmia, which increases in prevalence in patients older than 60 years.1 2 over time, it tends to become persistent or chronic, even if no underlying structural heart disease is present.1 2 evidence that af promotes af emerges from the fact that the success rate of electrical cardioversion and the maintenance of sinus rhythm are highly dependent on the duration of the previous af episode.3 4 a possible explanation for these epidemiological and clinical observations, apart from the progressive change caused by underlying cardiovascular disease, is the concept of electrical remodelling of the atria: af itself causes progressive electrophysiological and structural changes to the atria, which promote the initiation or perpetuation of af.5 

the phenomenon of “af begetting more af” was first described in a goat model. atrial electrical remodelling induced by af seemed to develop quickly, to be progressive, and to be completely reversible within one week after restoration of sinus rhythm.5 to date, many reports have confirmed the presence of atrial electrical remodelling after short and long term af or rapid atrial pacing in animal models.6-12 in humans, the time course of appearance and reversal of atrial electrical remodelling resembles that seen in goats and dogs.13-21 

the mechanism behind this phenomenon has not yet been clarified. there are some indications that intracellular calcium overload plays an important role. in both animal and human models, verapamil administered during rapid atrial pacing or short episodes of artificially induced af reduces atrial electrical remodelling.7 9 12 14 16 by contrast, pretreatment with verapamil results in a shortening of refractory periods in humans and animals with long lasting af.11 18 22 23 only two studies have found that the use of calcium antagonists or β blockers reduces …",Bertaglia E,2001,Heart,https://doi.org/10.1136/heart.85.5.578,11303016,Bertaglia E; D'Este D; Zanocco A; Zerbo F; Pascotto P,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016422: Letter; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,D000368: Aged; D000889: Anti-Arrhythmia Agents; D001281: Atrial Fibrillation; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D004554: Electric Countershock; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D011446: Prospective Studies; D012008: Recurrence; D014700: Verapamil,,,https://openalex.org/W2018029794,144,19,1,1899,312,4

false,incidental retinal phototoxicity associated with ingestion of photosensitizing drugs,"background: to report on the possible correlation between incident retinal phototoxicity and the use of photosensitizing drugs.
methods: four patients were examined because of scotomas and visual loss after an incidental exposure to a strong light source. one patient (two eyes) was exposed to standard camera flash; one patient (one eye) had a brief exposure to welding light; one patient (two eyes) underwent uncomplicated phacoemulsifications with intraocular lens implantation. the fourth patient had a severe retinal phototoxicity following a secondary intraocular lens implantation. all four patients underwent a thorough assessment including history of systemic drug use. these patients had ophthalmologic evaluation including: best corrected visual acuity (etdrs charts), fundus examination, fluorescein and indocyanine green angiographies and were followed for 1 year.
results: on presentation, the mean visual acuity was 7.5/20 (range: 20/400-20/20). fundus examination disclosed yellow-gray sub-retinal lesions in all affected eyes. early phase fluorescein angiography showed one or multiple hypofluorescent spots surrounded by a halo of hyperfluorescent window defect. in the late phase, some of these spots leaked the fluorescein dye. indocyanine green angiography demonstrated hypofluorescent spots throughout with ill-defined borders of hyperfluorescence observed during the late stages. the common finding in these four patients was the fact that they were all taking one or more photosensitizing drugs (hydrochlorothiazide, furosemide, allopurinol, and benzodiazepines). three of the patients had a full visual recovery a few months after the phototoxicity. the fourth patient remained with a visual acuity of 20/60 12 months after the light exposure. despite the visual recovery, non-homogeneous retinal pigment epithelial disturbances persisted in all affected eyes.

false,comparative pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amlodipine in hypertensive patients with and without type ii diabetes mellitus,"recent clinical trials aimed at attenuating complications in diabetes mellitus have generated interest in the impact of drug formulation and altered pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics in diabetes. specifically, it has been proposed that the diabetic state may alter the pharmacokinetics of several cardiovascular drugs, including some calcium antagonists. the present study investigates the effects of diabetes mellitus on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of amlodipine in hypertensive subjects with and without diabetes mellitus to determine whether the diabetic state alters these parameters. this trial consisted of a 2-week placebo washout phase, a 2-week titration phase, and a 2-week maintenance phase. study patients included 18 hypertensive patients with type ii diabetes mellitus and 10 nondiabetic hypertensive patients. blood samples were collected after administration of amlodipine and auc, cmax, and tmax were determined. the acute 24-hour pharmacodynamic response to amlodipine was assessed by blood pressure and telemetric heart rate measurements. there were no significant differences for either amlodipine 5 or 10 mg in auc (p = 0.40 for 5 mg; p = 0.59 for 10 mg), cmax (p = 0.41 for 5 mg; p = 0.45 for 10 mg), and tmax (p = 0.79 for 5 mg; p = 0.67 for 10 mg) between diabetic and nondiabetic hypertensive subjects. similarly, the 24-hour pharmacodynamic effects of amlodipine on systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate did not differ between diabetic and nondiabetic subjects as assessed by repeated-measures analysis of variance. because of the theoretical basis for anticipating that diabetes mellitus may provoke important pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic alterations, our study provides an important database in clearly demonstrating that the diabetic milieu did not alter the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of amlodipine.",Preston RA,2001,J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1177/00912700122012760,11697754,Preston RA; Chung M; Gaffney M; Alonso A; Baltodano NM; Epstein M,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D018848: Controlled Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D017311: Amlodipine; D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D019540: Area Under Curve; D001794: Blood Pressure; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D005260: Female; D006339: Heart Rate; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged",,,https://openalex.org/W2021829014,131,16,1,1892,307,10

false,treatment of heart failure in patients with diabetes mellitus,"patients with diabetes mellitus have an increased morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular disease. both coronary artery disease and congestive heart failure (chf) are largely responsible for the increased cardiovascular adverse events in patients with diabetes. this review discusses the pathophysiology of chf, the mechanisms of left ventricular (lv) dysfunction and the neurohormonal mechanisms involved in both lv dysfunction and chf. diabetes with and without hypertension is an important cause of lv dysfunction and chf. diabetes may be responsible for the metabolic and ultrastructural causes of lv dysfunction, while hypertension may be responsible for the marked fibrotic changes that are found. experimental induction of diabetes in animals has shed light on the biochemical and ultrastructural changes seen. the role of insulin to reverse both metabolic and structural changes is reviewed both from experimental data and with the limited amount of clinical data available. the therapy of chf in patients with diabetes is similar to that of patients without diabetes, with therapy directed toward the use of beta-blockers and angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors. as the morbidity and mortality are higher in patients with diabetes, several studies have pointed out the importance of this subgroup where the opportunity to make a significant clinical impact exists. a significant opportunity exists to reduce morbidity and mortality with beta-blockers and ace inhibitors when ischaemia and chf are both present. however, studies in patients diabetes have been limited to post hoc subgroup analyses and rarely as predefined subgroups. clinical trials involving patients with diabetes with and without hypertension and lv dysfunction are clearly needed in the future to adequately address the needs of this high risk subgroup.",Lavine SJ,2002,Drugs,https://doi.org/10.2165/00003495-200262020-00004,11817974,Lavine SJ; Gellman SD,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't; D016454: Review",D000818: Animals; D009202: Cardiomyopathies; D048909: Diabetes Complications; D006333: Heart Failure; D006801: Humans,,,https://openalex.org/W2092950665,61,9,1,1847,294,12

false,effect of calcium channel antagonist diltiazem and calcium ionophore a23187 on cyclosporine a‐induced apoptosis of renal tubular cells,"calcium channel antagonists have been reported to have a favorable impact on cyclosporin a (csa)‐treated kidney transplant recipients. however, it is not clear whether this is because of their direct effect on antagonizing the toxicity of csa to renal tubular cells. in this study, we have used madin–darby canine kidney tubular cells as a model to examine the effect of diltiazem, a calcium channel antagonist, on csa‐induced apoptosis. moreover, to investigate the possible regulation of csa cytotoxicity by intracellular calcium level, the effect of the calcium ionophore a23187 on csa‐induced apoptosis was also examined. we found that treatment of csa (20 μm) alone caused 20–30% cell death, which was apparently (30–40%) enhanced by diltiazem at 100 μg/ml, accompanied by more severe dna fragmentation, activation of caspases, and a decreased level of bcl‐2. the caspase inhibitor zvad‐fmk or bcl‐2 overexpression was capable of suppressing apoptosis induced by the synergistic effect of diltiazem and csa. moreover, the survival rate of cells treated with csa (30 μm) alone remained only 30%, however, it was markedly (∼40%) elevated by co‐treatment with a23187 (75 ng/ml). the rescue of cells from csa‐induced apoptosis by a23187 was correlated with akt activation, bad phosphorylation, and caspase‐3 inactivation. taken together, our results suggest that the reported favorable impact of diltiazem on kidney grafts is likely not because of its direct protection on renal tubular cells. instead, it enhances the toxicity of csa to renal tubular cells. in addition, our findings raise a possibility that the intracellular calcium level and the akt pathway may participate in the regulation of csa cytotoxicity.",Cheng CH,2002,FEBS Lett,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0014-5793(02)02563-2,11959131,Cheng CH; Hsieh CL; Shu KH; Chen YL; Chen HC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000818: Animals; D017209: Apoptosis; D000001: Calcimycin; D002118: Calcium; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D053148: Caspase 3; D020169: Caspases; D002478: Cells, Cultured; D016572: Cyclosporine; D053938: DNA Fragmentation; D004268: DNA-Binding Proteins; D004110: Diltiazem; D004285: Dogs; D004789: Enzyme Activation; D015870: Gene Expression; D019254: Genes, bcl-2; D007476: Ionophores; D007684: Kidney Tubules; D050778: NFATC Transcription Factors; D009687: Nuclear Proteins; D014157: Transcription Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2076277952,134,18,1,1717,307,11

false,"topical lidocaine does not limit autonomic dysreflexia during anorectal procedures in spinal cord injury: a prospective, double-blind study","background and aims: autonomic dysreflexia is a common and potentially dangerous response in patients with spinal cord injury at t6 or above. acute blood pressure elevation may be precipitated by rectosigmoid distention and anal manipulation. topical anesthetics are widely recommended to minimize the incidence and severity of autonomic dysreflexia, although no scientific evidence supports or refutes this practice. this study tested whether topical lidocaine would prevent or limit anorectal procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.
patients and methods: we enrolled patients with chronic, complete spinal cord injury scheduled for anoscopy and/or flexible sigmoidoscopy. in a double-blind fashion they were randomized to receive either 2% lidocaine jelly (n = 18) or nonmedicated lubricant (control; n = 32) just prior to the procedure. we measured blood pressure before, during, and after procedures.
results: mean maximal systolic blood pressure increased 35 +/- 25 mmhg in the lidocaine group vs. 45 +/- 30 mmhg in the control group (ns). however, there was a significant difference between anoscopic procedures and flexible sigmoidoscopies without anoscopy (49 +/- 29 vs. 25 +/- 20 mmhg).
conclusion: topical lidocaine did not significantly limit or prevent autonomic dysreflexia in susceptible patients. both anoscopy and flexible sigmoidoscopy caused significant blood pressure elevation. anoscopy, which involves stretching of the anal sphincters, was a more potent stimulus for autonomic dysreflexia than flexible sigmoidoscopy, which involves gaseous distention of the rectosigmoid. anal sphincter stretch and rectosigmoid distention, rather than a mucosal stimulus, are likely nociceptive triggers for procedure-associated autonomic dysreflexia.",Cosman BC,2002,Int J Colorectal Dis,https://doi.org/10.1007/s003840100347,12014417,Cosman BC; Vu TT; Plowman BK,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000287: Administration, Topical; D000779: Anesthetics, Local; D020211: Autonomic Dysreflexia; D001794: Blood Pressure; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D005260: Female; D006484: Hemorrhoids; D006801: Humans; D008012: Lidocaine; D008026: Ligation; D008297: Male; D011351: Proctoscopy; D011446: Prospective Studies; D012812: Sigmoidoscopy; D013119: Spinal Cord Injuries",,,https://openalex.org/W2002243414,139,20,1,1765,280,13

false,[medicamentous kidney protection in type 2 diabetic patients--is cheaper also more economical? a model calculation for swiss health care].,"impaired renal function occurs in about 50% of patients suffering from type 2 diabetes, and diabetic nephropathy has become the leading cause of endstage renal disease. reduction of blood pressure to levels around 120/80 mmhg is one of the most effective way to slow progression of diabetic nephropathy. recent meta-analyses, however, have emphasized on the fact that ace inhibitors (acei) and non-dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers (ndhp-ccb) exert nephro-protective effects which go beyond the effect of blood pressure reduction. this has lately been confirmed by a prospective trial in comparison to the betablocker atenolol. based on these data, demographics of the swiss population, literature data on mortality rates of type 2 diabetics with impaired renal function and studies on true costs of antihypertensives, we calculated the costs of a longterm intervention (20 years) with antihypertensives in 3536 middle-aged swiss patients with type 2 diabetes and macro-albuminuria whose antihypertensive regimen was based either on the acei lisinopril, or the nd-hp-ccb verapamil, or the betablocker atenolol. under atenolol, acquisition costs were lowest, whereas faster loss of renal function over time increased mortality rate and thus reduced the number of patients to be treated. nevertheless, due to the fact that patients reached uremia and had to be dialyzed, 20 years of atenolol-based regimen with costs of 316 millions of swiss francs turned out to be much more expensive than the lisinopril- or the verapamil-based regimen with 121 and 38 millions of swiss francs, respectively. thus, low acquisition cost is not necessarily the only important determinant of overall costs of drug therapy.",Faller J,2002,Praxis (Bern 1994),10.1024/0369-8394.91.19.836,12071084,Faller J; Hess B,article,D003160: Comparative Study; D004740: English Abstract; D016428: Journal Article,"D000328: Adult; D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D001262: Atenolol; D017046: Cost Savings; D003362: Cost-Benefit Analysis; D003924: Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; D003928: Diabetic Nephropathies; D016527: Drug Costs; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D007676: Kidney Failure, Chronic; D007677: Kidney Function Tests; D017706: Lisinopril; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D018803: Models, Economic; D013557: Switzerland; D014700: Verapamil",,,https://openalex.org/W2050361175,138,25,2,1709,286,8

results: the incidence of drh was 9.4 admissions per 10,000 treated patients [95% confidence interval (ci) 9.0-9.9]. rates were highest for antithrombotics with 26.9 admissions per 10,000 treated patients (95% ci 23.6, 30.1). most frequent events were gastroduodenal lesions and bleeding (45%). digitalis preparations showed a linearly increasing trend from 2/10,000 to 14/10,000 during ten quarters ( p<0.0001), which was exclusively attributable to digitoxin, the major source of digitalis in the study area (93%). the incidence of drh increased with age (4/10,000 to 20/10,000). the mean length of stays in patients with drh was 13+/-10.6 days. cumulative direct costs for hospitalization were euro 4 million in the two urban study areas. the annual direct costs for germany were estimated to be euro 400 million.
conclusions: drhs are a considerable public health and economic burden. a longitudinal design can observe changes in population-based incidence over time. this approach can be used for public-health planning or to evaluate outcomes of quality management programs designed to reduce drug-induced illness.",Schneeweiss S,2002,Eur J Clin Pharmacol,https://doi.org/10.1007/s00228-002-0467-0,12136375,Schneeweiss S; Hasford J; Göttler M; Hoffmann A; Riethling AK; Avorn J,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000293: Adolescent; D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D002648: Child; D002675: Child, Preschool; D064420: Drug-Related Side Effects and Adverse Reactions; D004636: Emergency Service, Hospital; D005260: Female; D005858: Germany; D006748: Hospital Departments; D006801: Humans; D015994: Incidence; D007223: Infant; D007231: Infant, Newborn; D007388: Internal Medicine; D007902: Length of Stay; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D010343: Patient Admission; D011446: Prospective Studies",,,https://openalex.org/W2079842711,139,19,1,1821,312,17

false,drug treatment of hypertension,"hypertension is one of the most important preventable causes of premature death worldwide,1 and the benefits of antihypertensive drugs have been confirmed by the largest evidence base from clinical trials in medicine. many classes of drugs are available for treatment, and debate has raged about whether the benefits of treatment are purely a function of the quality of blood pressure control or whether the type of drug used might also be a powerful determinant of outcome. this is a key question because the difference in cost between “older” drugs (thiazides or β blockers) and “newer” drugs (such as angiotensin converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors or calcium channel blockers) is substantial. a meta-analysis of trials of treatment for hypertension with the newer drugs found that ace inhibitors and calcium channel blockers were likely to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality by the same order of magnitude as β blockers or thiazides,2 but such analyses have insufficient statistical power to detect cause specific outcomes with regard to specific drugs.

recently, the “antihypertensive and lipid lowering to prevent heart attack trial” (allhat)—the largest ever randomised trial of antihypertensive treatment—reported its results.3 it was designed to determine whether the choice of first line treatment for hypertension influenced cardiovascular outcome. importantly, the trial was sufficiently large to examine cause specific outcomes and was the first hypertension study to have sufficient power to examine the combined incidence of fatal coronary heart disease and non-fatal myocardial infarction as the primary end point.

false,recent developments in obstetrics,"two of the most challenging areas in antenatal care are prematurity and pre-eclampsia. between them they affect one in 10 of all pregnant women, and their prevalence is static. until recently management options have been limited. improved understanding of the basic pathophysiology is changing this.

this article describes those advances that have made an impact on the management of prematurity and pre-eclampsia. another major concern in obstetrics is the rising number of interventions, particularly caesarean sections, without obvious benefit to mother or baby. recent research has highlighted several simple but effective strategies that could help influence this trend. these include management of previous caesarean sections and breech presentation and more appropriate use of fetal monitoring and epidurals in labour; knowledge of these will be valuable to any clinician who comes into contact with pregnant women. the articles selected are from relevant searches in english from pubmed and the cochrane collaboration, as well as the author's own experience through research and reviewing.

the current structure of antenatal care developed around detecting pre-eclampsia. the detection of hypertension and proteinuria, the defining signs of this syndrome, is the key aim of frequent surveillance in pregnancy. pre-eclampsia occurs in about 3% of pregnant women and results in around 100 000 maternal deaths per year worldwide. the fetus is also affected, directly through placental insufficiency and indirectly through iatrogenic delivery; this accounts for 25% of all infants with a very low birth weight (< 1500 g). the onset and course of pre-eclampsia are unpredictable, and it therefore results in enormous use of health resources. accurate prediction and targeted preventive measures would have enormous benefit.

false,nifedipine,"the purpose of this study was to assess the effect of the dose of nifedipine, a dihydropyridine calcium antagonist, on the increased risk of mortality seen in the randomized secondary-prevention trials and to review the mechanisms by which this adverse effect might occur.we restricted the dose-response meta-analysis to the 16 randomized secondary-prevention trials of nifedipine for which mortality data were available. recent trials of any calcium antagonist and formulation were also reviewed for information about the possible mechanisms of action that might increase mortality. overall, the use of nifedipine was associated with a significant adverse effect on total mortality (risk ratio, 1.16, with a 95% ci of 1.01 to 1.33). this summary estimate fails to draw attention to an important dose-response relationship. for daily doses of 30 to 50, 60, and 80 mg, the risk ratios for total mortality were 1.06 (95% ci, 0.89 to 1.27), 1.18 (95% ci, 0.93 to 1.50), and 2.83 (95% ci, 1.35 to 5.93), respectively. in a formal test of dose response, the high doses of nifedipine were significantly associated with increased mortality (p = .01). while the mechanism of this adverse effect is not known, there are several plausible explanations, including the established proischemic effect, negative inotropic effects, marked hypotension, recently reported prohemorrhagic effects attributed to antiplatelet and vasodilatory actions of calcium antagonists, and possibly proarrhythmic effects.in patients with coronary disease, the use of short-acting nifedipine in moderate to high doses causes an increase in total mortality. other calcium antagonists may have similar adverse effects, in particular those of the dihydropyridine type. long-term safety data are lacking for most calcium antagonists.",Furberg CD,1995,Circulation,https://doi.org/10.1161/01.cir.92.5.1326,7648682,Furberg CD; Psaty BM; Meyer JV,article,D016428: Journal Article; D017418: Meta-Analysis,"D000787: Angina Pectoris; D001145: Arrhythmias, Cardiac; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D016001: Confidence Intervals; D003327: Coronary Disease; D003864: Depression, Chemical; D004095: Dihydropyridines; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D006470: Hemorrhage; D006801: Humans; D007022: Hypotension; D009200: Myocardial Contraction; D017202: Myocardial Ischemia; D009543: Nifedipine; D016017: Odds Ratio; D012084: Renin-Angiotensin System; D013564: Sympathetic Nervous System; D013997: Time Factors",,,https://openalex.org/W2092805838,10,1,1,1796,313,9

false,emergent management of the patient in preterm labor,"clinicians who treat ptl should realize that side effects rarely occur when tocolytic medications are properly used. the beneficial effects of tocolytic therapy vastly outweigh the risks associated with their use for the prolongation of gestation. even a short extension of in utero life for a few days or weeks can significantly and positively affect neonatal survival and long-term outcome. although the opponents of tocolytic therapy argue that no reduction in the ptb rate has occurred since their introduction, this argument does not consider that the large majority of ptbs are not eligible for tocolytic intervention. if patients with clear indications for tocolysis could be compared with those that were not treated (which most studies have not done), a substantial beneficial effect of tocolytic administration probably would be demonstrated. based on available data, we consider mgso4 and terbutaline to be first-line tocolytics. magnesium is used more often because of its lower side-effect profile. indomethacin and nifedipine should be reserved for difficult or refractory preterm labor, and should only be used for intervals of ≤ 48 hours. we have attempted to present a method of decision analysis which should be followed for every patient who is admitted to the obstetric care unit for a presumptive diagnosis of premature labor. we realize that many of the issues included here are controversial, however, we hope that by developing a decision tree (see fig. 1), a more complete management scheme will be created and lead to improved care of the patient undergoing premature labor.",Sullivan CA,1995,Obstet Gynecol Clin North Am,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0889-8545(21)00175-3,7651666,Sullivan CA; Morrison JC,article,"D016428: Journal Article; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000318: Adrenergic beta-Agonists; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D008278: Magnesium Sulfate; D007752: Obstetric Labor, Premature; D010353: Patient Education as Topic; D017410: Practice Guidelines as Topic; D011247: Pregnancy; D011448: Prostaglandin Antagonists; D012307: Risk Factors; D015145: Tocolysis; D014187: Transportation of Patients",,,https://openalex.org/W2472381624,51,8,1,1600,272,11

false,the effects of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs on blood pressures of patients with hypertension controlled by verapamil,"background: nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs may attenuate the antihypertensive effects of diuretics, β-blockers, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, central α-agonists, and other vasodilators. their effects on the antihypertensive efficacy of calcium channel blockers are inadequately studied in small numbers of patients but appear to be minimal. methods: a three-phase, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study included 162 patients aged 18 to 75 years with essential hypertension. after diastolic blood pressure was controlled to 90 mm hg or less with once-daily verapamil hydrochloride, patients received ibuprofen, naproxen, or placebo matching capsules for 3 weeks, and blood pressure, heart rate, weight, and adverse effects were evaluated. a general linear model with 95% confidence intervals was used to compare each nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatment group with the placebo group. results: no significant differences in sitting, standing, or supine blood pressure were noted with naproxen or ibuprofen compared with placebo. the percentages of patients in each treatment group with increases of 10 mm hg or more in either systolic or diastolic blood pressure were similar. statistically significant increases in weight were seen with both nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapies. changes in pulse rate were not significant. the incidence of adverse effects was similar across all three treatment groups. conclusions: the addition of naproxen or ibuprofen to the treatment of hypertensive patients in whom blood pressure is controlled by once-daily verapamil does not cause an increase in blood pressure. verapamil may therefore offer considerable advantages in maintaining control of blood pressure in patients who regularly receive nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug therapy.

false,effects of calcium antagonists on renal hemodynamics and progression of nondiabetic chronic renal disease,"in recent years, substantial investigative attention has focused on therapeutic regimens that could retard the progression of chronic renal insufficiency. emphasis has been placed on the effects of antihypertensive treatment on renal hemodynamics and preservation of renal function. it has been suggested that some classes of antihypertensive agents may confer a greater renoprotective effect, especially agents that lower glomerular capillary pressure. conversely, by virtue of their ability to preferentially dilate the afferent arteriole calcium antagonists theoretically could favor an increase in glomerular capillary pressure thereby accelerating the decline of renal function. in this review we survey the literature critically and conclude that in patients with essential hypertension and in patients with chronic renal insufficiency, calcium antagonists effectively reduce systemic blood pressure while maintaining glomerular filtration rate and effective renal plasma flow. preliminary results from a few long-term studies suggest that calcium antagonists may even attenuate the decline in renal function of patients with chronic renal failure. the majority of studies in humans, however, have been nonrandomized, of too short duration, or confounded by investigative difficulties precluding definite conclusions whether calcium antagonists have renoprotective effects. although the possibility that calcium antagonists may retard progression of renal disease remains to be ascertained, the available evidence indicates that calcium antagonists may be used in patients with renal functional impairment without further exacerbating renal function.",ter Wee PM,1994,Arch Intern Med,https://doi.org/10.1001/archinte.1994.00420110021004,8203987,ter Wee PM; De Micheli AG; Epstein M,article,D016428: Journal Article; D016454: Review,"D000818: Animals; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D002986: Clinical Trials as Topic; D006439: Hemodynamics; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D007668: Kidney; D007676: Kidney Failure, Chronic; D012079: Renal Circulation",,,https://openalex.org/W2148748683,105,14,1,1656,238,8

false,calcium channel blockers blunt postural cutaneous vasoconstriction in hypertensive patients,"the aim of this work was to test whether calcium channel blockers interfere with skin vasoconstrictor reflexes that minimize postural increases in capillary pressure and avoid fluid extravasation and eventually subcutaneous edema. studies were conducted in 23 untreated mild to moderate essential hypertensives; drugs, either calcium channel blockers or not, were given for 2 weeks according to a crossover, sequence-randomized design. skin blood flow was measured by laser doppler flowmetry in two skin areas: (1) the dorsum of the foot, where arteriovenous anastomoses are poorly represented, and (2) the plantar surface of the great toe, where those anastomoses are predominant. determinations were obtained both with the foot at heart level and with it placed passively 50 cm below the heart level; percent flow changes from the horizontal to the dependent position were the measure of postural vasoconstriction. two dihydropyridine derivatives, amlodipine (10 mg uid) and nifedipine (60 mg uid), and verapamil (240 mg bid), a chemically unrelated compound, diminished to similar extents the postural fall in skin blood flow at the dorsum of the foot. blockade of alpha1-adrenergic and at-1 subtype angiotensin ii receptors by doxazosin (4 mg uid) and losartan (50 mg uid), respectively, exerted no effect. postural skin blood flow responses at the plantar surface of the great toe were unmodified during the pharmacological trials. thus, calcium channel blockers of different chemical origins antagonized postural skin vasoconstriction at the dorsum of the foot. the data indicate altered postural capillary blood flow regulation, since arteriovenous anastomoses are anatomically absent at this site; the effect was independent of either alpha1-adrenoceptor or angiotensin ii receptor antagonism. interference with skin postural vasoconstrictor mechanisms may result in net filtration of fluid to the extravascular compartment. this mechanism might explain the as yet unknown pathogenesis of ankle edema during treatment with calcium antagonists.",Iabichella ML,1997,Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/01.hyp.29.3.751,9052891,Iabichella ML; Dell'Omo G; Melillo E; Pedrinelli R,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D018592: Cross-Over Studies; D005260: Female; D005528: Foot; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D017078: Laser-Doppler Flowmetry; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009543: Nifedipine; D011187: Posture; D011897: Random Allocation; D012867: Skin; D014661: Vasoconstriction; D014700: Verapamil,,,https://openalex.org/W2126245220,91,10,1,2051,342,11

methods: during a 2-week placebo run-in period, patients were required to have two treadmill exercise tests (modified bruce protocol) differing by not more than 15% with regard to total exercise time (tet). of 313 patients enrolled, 248 were randomized and 212 completed the study according to the protocol.
results: the primary variable tet was analysed using the cox proportional hazards model to take into account censored values due to the patient stopping the exercise test for reasons other than angina. forty-three per cent of patients allocated to carvedilol and 36% to verapamil did not stop with angina at the final visit. there was no difference in the tet between the groups, the risk ratio being 1.14 in favour of carvedilol (90% ci 0.85-1.52). tet increased from 378 s at baseline to 436 s at the final visit in the carvedilol group and from 386 to 438 s in the verapamil group. results for time to angina and time to 1 mm st-segment depression were similar. compared to verapamil, carvedilol significantly reduced hr, systolic bp and rate pressure product at peak exercise. analysis of 48 h holter monitor data showed a greater reduction of hr and pvcs with carvedilol. lown grading improved in both groups. adverse events were reported by 48% (3.2% serious adverse events) of patients taking carvedilol and 58% (5.7% serious adverse events) taking verapamil.

design: a double-blind, randomised, parallel group multicentre trial.
methods: 239 patients received 50 mg mibefradil or 5 mg amlodipine for 4 weeks, followed by a forced titration to 100 mg mibefradil or 10 mg amlodipine for an additional 8 weeks. patients then entered a 4-week withdrawal period either on therapy or switched to placebo.
results: statistically equivalent reductions in trough sitting diastolic blood pressure (sdbp) were observed after 12 weeks of once-daily treatment with 50/100 mg mibefradil (-11.5 +/- 8.2 mm hg) and 5/10 mg amlodipine (-13.2 +/- 7.9 mm hg). the number of patients with normalised sdbp (< or = 90 mm hg) increased 23.3% in the mibefradil group and 19.5% in the amlodipine group (approximately 74% in both groups). patients on mibefradil or amlodipine during the withdrawal period had significantly larger decreases in sdbp than those on placebo. patients on mibefradil had a decrease in heart rate of 5.5 bpm. patients on amlodipine had no change in heart rate; however, cessation of amlodipine was associated with a decrease in heart rate.

false,a challenge to the concept that the use of calcium channel blockers causes reversible male infertility,"the objective of this study was retrospectively to evaluate both in-vitro fertilization (ivf) and non-ivf cycles in which the male partner had been taking calcium channel blockers, either to confirm or refute previous data from another centre, suggesting that these drugs cause a severe but reversible subfertility problem in the male. these drugs were found to inhibit expression of mannose-ligand binding receptors, thus preventing spermatozoa from attaching to the zona pellucida; they were postulated to cause failed fertilization based on one case having this defect, in whom a return to normal was achieved after stopping the drug. however, the couple did not undergo a cycle with ivf to see if fertilization now occurred. the data presented here demonstrated fertilization in all patients having ivf who were taking calcium channel blockers. the subsequent pregnancy rate per transfer was 17.4%. also, five out of 11 (45.4%) non-ivf patients conceived after correction of various female factors. failure of the other six patients to conceive could be explained by other confounding factors, especially oligoasthenozoospermia. taking into consideration other data suggesting poor fertilization when this mannose-ligand binding receptor abnormality was demonstrated, we propose the possibility that this defect, when not associated with calcium channel blockers, may be associated with some other cryptic factor that causes poor fertilization. according to our hypothesis, calcium channel blockers might cause the problem in mannose expression but also adversely affect some other factor that is deficient when non-drug related abnormalities in mannose-ligand binding expression are found.",Katsoff D,1997,Hum Reprod,https://doi.org/10.1093/humrep/12.7.1480,9262281,Katsoff D; Check JH,article,D016428: Journal Article,"D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D004110: Diltiazem; D004624: Embryo Transfer; D005260: Female; D005307: Fertilization in Vitro; D006801: Humans; D007248: Infertility, Male; D008297: Male; D009845: Oligospermia; D011247: Pregnancy; D012189: Retrospective Studies; D014700: Verapamil",,,https://openalex.org/W2136725143,102,16,1,1694,273,9

false,salt and blood pressure responses to calcium antagonism in hypertensive patients,"since salt intake may affect blood pressure response to antihypertensive drugs, an individual's salt-sensitivity status may be an important consideration in the selection of a medication. the purpose of this single-blind study was to assess the impact of salt sensitivity on the antihypertensive effects of isradipine. a total of 21 evaluable hypertensive patients (10 white, 11 black) 35 to 73 years of age (mean 55.9 years) were randomized to a low-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine sodium 100+/-14 mmol) or a high-salt diet (mean 24-hour urine sodium 210+/-22 mmol) for 7 weeks, followed by crossover to the other diet after a 2-week washout period. on each diet regimen, patients received placebo for 2 weeks, followed by optimal titration of isradipine (2.5 to 10 mg bid) for blood pressure control during the last 5 weeks. on the high-salt diet, salt-sensitive hypertensives (mean arterial blood pressure increase > or = 5 mm hg, n=5) exhibited a systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of -18.7/-19.6 mm hg from 157.2/102.9 mm hg after 5 weeks of isradipine treatment, whereas on a low-salt diet, blood pressure change was -6.9/-12.0 mm hg from 148.7/97.3 mm hg. non-salt-sensitive patients (n=16) exhibited a systolic/diastolic blood pressure change of -12.6/-7.6 mm hg from 155.3/98.6 mm hg on the high-salt diet and -19.2/-10.9 mm hg from 161.0/102.6 mm hg on the low-salt diet after treatment with isradipine. the absolute blood pressure attained in both salt-sensitive and non-salt-sensitive patients was almost identical with isradipine therapy despite variation in dietary salt, although slightly higher doses of isradipine were required in the salt-sensitive group. consequently, isradipine, and perhaps calcium antagonists in general, manifests a more robust blood pressure-lowering effect in the setting of high sodium intake. this effect does, however, appear to be largely confined to individuals who are salt sensitive.",Weir MR,1997,Hypertension,https://doi.org/10.1161/01.hyp.30.3.422,9314427,Weir MR; Hall PS; Behrens MT; Flack JM,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't","D000328: Adult; D000368: Aged; D000959: Antihypertensive Agents; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D018592: Cross-Over Studies; D004039: Diet, Sodium-Restricted; D004351: Drug Resistance; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D017275: Isradipine; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D016037: Single-Blind Method; D012965: Sodium Chloride",,,https://openalex.org/W2023281555,80,11,1,1936,334,9

methods: thirty patients of both sexes (mean age 71 years) with mild to moderate essential hypertension were recruited from our hypertension outpatient clinic. after a 2-week placebo period, felodipine extended-release (felodipine er), 10 mg once daily, nifedipine slow-release retard (nifedipine sr), 20 mg twice daily or placebo were administered to each patient for 2 weeks according to a 3 x 3 latin-square design. at the end of each treatment period, the patients underwent 24-h noninvasive blood pressure monitoring.
results: all of the patients completed the trial and no serious adverse experience was reported. in comparison with placebo, felodipine and nifedipine decreased mean 24-h diastolic blood pressure by 6.7 and 4.3 mmhg, respectively, with no significant difference between the two drugs. mean 24-h systolic blood pressure also decreased after felodipine and nifedipine, with no difference between the two drugs. both drugs reduced blood pressure variability, lowering the 24-h mean standard deviation of mean hourly blood pressure values. the trough:peak ratio for felodipine was 80% for systolic and 75% for diastolic blood pressure.

methods: sixty hypertensive patients (asa ii), defined as systolic blood pressure > 160 mmhg and/or diastolic blood pressure > 95 mmhg (world health organization), undergoing elective surgery received, in a randomized, double-blind manner, 0.3 mg.kg-1 diltiazem, 1.5 mg.kg-1 lidocaine, or 0.3 mg.kg-1 diltiazem plus 1.5 mg.kg-1 lidocaine i.v. (n = 20 of each) before the initiation of laryngoscopy. anaesthesia was induced with 5 mg.kg-1 thiopentone i.v., and tracheal intubation was facilitated with 2 mg.kg-1 succinylcholine i.v. after precurarization with 0.02 mg.kg-1 vecuronium i.v. changes in heart rate (hr), mean arterial pressure (map) and rate-pressure product (rpp) were measured before and at immediate, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 10 min after tracheal intubation.
results: the inhibitory effects of diltiazem-lidocaine combination on cardiovascular responses to tracheal intubation was greater than those of diltiazem or lidocaine as a sole medicine (rpp; 10,602 +/- 1448 (combination) vs 11,787 +/- 1345 (diltiazem), 15,428 +/- 1756 (lidocaine), mean +/- sd, p < 0.05).

false,divergent effects of ace-inhibition and calcium channel blockade on no-activity in systemic and renal circulation in essential hypertension,"objective: nitric oxide is a vasodilating and blood pressure lowering substance. to investigate whether calcium antagonists or angiotensin-converting enzyme (ace) inhibitors increase vascular nitric oxide activity, we assessed systemic and renal vascular sensitivity to nitric oxide synthase inhibition in hypertensives on and off medication. methods: ten essential hypertensive patients, aged 22–51 years, were studied 3 times: ≥4 weeks off medication, after 3 weeks treatment with enalapril 20 mg twice a day and after 3 weeks nifedipine 60 mg/day. each time, 24-h blood pressure registration was performed, followed by a clearance study to obtain a 3-h dose-response curve for intravenously infused ng-monomethyl-l-arginine (l-nmma, respectively 0.75, 1.5 and 3.0 mg/kg/h). results:l-nmma dose-dependently increased mean arterial pressure with 5±2 mmhg and systemic vascular resistance with 24±5% at maximum dose, whereas cardiac output decreased (all p<0.001). enalapril and nifedipine treatment decreased blood pressure, while the l-nmma-induced increase in systemic vascular resistance was potentiated (enalapril: 45±7% and nifedipine: 46±8%; both p<0.01). l-nmma also dose-dependently decreased renal blood flow by 58±8% at maximum dose (p<0.001), but neither drug potentiated these effects. conclusion: these results indicate that, in essential hypertensives, antihypertensive therapy with enalapril or nifedipine increases nitric oxide dependency of systemic vascular tone, which may play a role in the blood pressure lowering effect of these drugs. however, this phenomenon cannot be observed in the renal circulation, suggesting a different regulation of endothelium-dependent vasomotion in the hypertensive kidney.",Dijkhorst-Oei LT,1998,Cardiovasc Res,https://doi.org/10.1016/s0008-6363(98)00124-2,9893735,Dijkhorst-Oei LT; Beutler JJ; Stroes ES; Koomans HA; Rabelink TJ,article,D016430: Clinical Trial; D016428: Journal Article; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial,"D000328: Adult; D000806: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D002302: Cardiac Output; D004305: Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; D004656: Enalapril; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D008297: Male; D008875: Middle Aged; D009543: Nifedipine; D009569: Nitric Oxide; D019001: Nitric Oxide Synthase; D012079: Renal Circulation; D014655: Vascular Resistance; D019323: omega-N-Methylarginine",,,https://openalex.org/W1994242412,139,18,1,1726,287,9
false,improved efficacy with maintained tolerability in the treatment of primary hypertension. comparison between the felodipine-metoprolol combination tablet and monotherapy with enalapril,"in this multicentre, double-blind, parallel-group study, 120 out-patients with mild to moderate primary hypertension were randomised, after a 4-week single-blind placebo run-in period, to a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50 mg (logimax, mobloc, astra) once daily or enalapril 10 mg once daily. if blood pressure (bp) remained suboptimally controlled after 4 weeks (supine diastolic bp >90 mm hg 24-h post dose), the dose was doubled for a further 4 weeks. after 8 weeks felodipine-metoprolol reduced supine bp significantly more than enalapril (19.7/12.0 mmhg and 11.1/7.2 mm hg, respectively). the mean differences in change in bp between treatments were 8.6/4.8 mm hg in favour of felodipine-metoprolol (p = 0.001/p <0.001). a statistically significant difference to the advantage of felodipine-metoprolol was also seen in standing bp. even though the dose was increased in a larger proportion of patients in the enalapril group (61%) than in the felodipine-metoprolol group (40%), fewer enalapril-treated patients achieved adequate bp control (41% vs 63% on felodipine-metoprolol, p <0.05). both treatments were well tolerated. three patients treated with felodipine-metoprolol and four with enalapril discontinued treatment due to adverse events. a similar number of patients reported adverse events in each treatment group. in conclusion, a combination tablet of felodipine-metoprolol 5/50-10/100 mg once daily reduced bp more effectively than enalapril 10-20 mg once daily 24 h post dose. the result was expected, but a more important observation was that both treatments were tolerated to a similar degree. obviously, a considerable bp reduction may be well tolerated, as was the main purpose to demonstrate in this study.",Andersson OK,1999,J Hum Hypertens,https://doi.org/10.1038/sj.jhh.1000724,9928753,Andersson OK,article,"D016430: Clinical Trial; D003160: Comparative Study; D016428: Journal Article; D016448: Multicenter Study; D016449: Randomized Controlled Trial; D013485: Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't",D000319: Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; D000368: Aged; D000806: Angiotensin-Converting Enzyme Inhibitors; D001794: Blood Pressure; D002121: Calcium Channel Blockers; D004311: Double-Blind Method; D004338: Drug Combinations; D004656: Enalapril; D015736: Felodipine; D005260: Female; D006801: Humans; D006973: Hypertension; D008790: Metoprolol; D008875: Middle Aged; D013607: Tablets; D016896: Treatment Outcome,,,https://openalex.org/W2405509171,183,22,2,1744,306,12
